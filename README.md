Conversational Chat Application with Movie Script Retrieval
Overview
This project is a conversational chat application that leverages vector databases to store and retrieve movie scripts, enabling it to answer questions contextually based on the stored content. Additionally, it features general conversational capabilities, allowing users to interact beyond script-based queries.

Features
Movie Script-Based Question Answering: Stores and retrieves movie scripts from a vector database to provide relevant responses.
Conversational Chat System: Implements a message state graph using Langraph, making interactions more dynamic and allowing responses beyond database-dependent queries.
Two Chat Modes:
Simple Chat System: Answers one question at a time without remembering chat history.
Interactive Chat System: Maintains chat history and handles general conversations using MemorySaver Checkpointer in Langraph.
Efficient PDF Processing: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text from movie script PDFs.
Optimized Text Chunking: Leverages LangChainâ€™s Recursive Text Splitter to manage and structure script content.
Web Interface: Built with Gradio for a user-friendly experience.
