INCEPTION 
By 
Christopher Nolan 
SHOOTING SCRIPT FADE IN: 
DAWN. CRASHING SURF. 
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies  there. 
A CHILD’S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a L ITTLE 
BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the  tide eat 
a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. T he Bearded 
Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNS EEN. He 
COLLAPSES. 
The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto hi s back. A 
JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then cal ls up the 
beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind  them is a 
cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE. 
INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE y LATER 
The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY 
JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to u s. 
ATTENDANT 
(in Japanese) 
He was delirious. But he asked for 
you by name. And... 
(to the Security Guard) 
Show him. 
SECURITY GUARD 
(in Japanese) 
He was carrying nothing but this... 
He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man kee ps eating. 
SECURITY GUARD 
...and this. 
The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE along side the 
gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the con e. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN 
(in Japanese) 
Bring him here. And some food. 
INT. SAME y MOMENTS LATER 
The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down h is food. 
He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN 
(in English) 
Are you here to kill me? 
The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his  food. The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and 
forefinger. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN 
I know what this  is. 
He SPINS it onto a tabley it CIRCLES gracefully acr oss the 
polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN 
I’ve seen one before. Many, many 
years ago... 
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmeriz ed. 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN 
It belonged to a man I met in a 
halfyremembered dream... 
MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP... 
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN 
A man possessed of some radical 
notions... 
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering... 
COBB (V.O.) 
What’s the most resilient parasite? 
CUT TO: 
INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM y NIGHT (YEARS EARLIE R) 
The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A you ng 
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens. 
COBB 
A bacteria? A virus? 
Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glassy 
COBB 
An intestinal worm? 
Saito’s fork pauses, midyair. Cobb GRINS. A third m an is at 
the tabley ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitchy 
ARTHUR 
What Mr. Cobb is trying to sayy 
COBB 
An idea .
Saito looks at Cobb, curious. 2. COBB 
Resilient, highly contagious. Once 
an idea’s taken hold in the brain 
it’s almost impossible to 
eradicate. A person can cover it 
up, ignore ity but it stays there. 
SAITO 
But surelyyto forget...? 
COBB 
Information, yes. But an idea ? 
Fully formed, understood ? That 
sticks... 
(taps forehead) 
In there, somewhere. 
SAITO 
For someone like you to steal? 
ARTHUR 
Yes. In the dream state, conscious 
defenses are lowered and your 
thoughts become vulnerable to 
theft. It’s called extraction. 
COBB 
But, Mr. Saito, we can train your 
subconscious to defend itself from 
even the most skilled extractor. 
SAITO 
How can you do that? 
COBB 
Because I am the most skilled 
extractor. I know how to search 
your mind and find your secrets. I 
know the tricks, and I can teach 
them to your subconscious so that 
even when you’re asleep, your guard 
is never down.  
Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito’s gaze. 
COBB 
But if I’m going to help you, you 
have to be completely open to me. 
I’ll need to know my way around 
your thoughts better than your 
wife, your analyst, anyone. 
(gestures around) 
If this is a dream and you’ve got a 
safe full of secrets, I need to 
know what’s in that safe. For this 
to work, you have to let me in. 3. Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BOD YGUARD 
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY. 
SAITO 
Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I 
consider your proposal. 
They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worri edy 
ARTHUR 
He knows. 
Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their 
glasses, Cobb glances at his watchy THE SECOND HAND  IS 
FROZEN. 
ARTHUR 
What’s going on up there? 
And wey 
CUT TO: 
FILTHY BATHROOM y DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME) 
Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A ST EAMING 
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinety the bottom of t he legs 
level with the rim of the tub. 
A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NA SH. A 
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash mo ves to the 
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVE LOPINGyWORLD 
CITYy the street filled with RIOTERSy SMASHING, BUR NING. 
Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tap e holds 
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb' s watchy 
THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY. 
Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Art hur's 
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connec t the 
briefcase to Arthur's wrist. 
Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcas e to where 
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through th e crack of 
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to 
his wrist. BOOMy a closer EXPLOSION, and wey

checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE 
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR , SAITO. 
Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME. 
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with  a MIGHTY 
WHUMP− Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping facey 
NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and wey

EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE y NIGHT 
A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and A rthur 
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and 
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA chur ns. Other 
GUESTS wander the massive terraces. 
ARTHUR 
Saito knows . He's playing with us. 
COBB 
I can get it here. The 
information's in the safe− he 
looked right at it when I mentioned 
secrets. 
Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulde r. 
ARTHUR 
What's she  doing here, Cobb? 
Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dres sed, 
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches h er. 
COBB 
You just get to your room. I'll 
take care of the rest. 
ARTHUR 
See that you do. We're here to 
work. 
Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She near s Cobb. 
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIRy 
MAL 
If I jumped, would I survive? 5. COBB 
With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, 
why are you here? 
She turns to look at him. Amused. 
MAL 
I thought you might be missing 
me... 
She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized. 
COBB 
I am. But I can't trust you 
anymore. 
She stares up at him, inviting. 
MAL 
So what? 
INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE y MOMENTS LATER
Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Fra ncis 
Bacon. 
MAL 
Looks like Arthur's taste. 
Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUAR DS 
patrolling the castle at ground level. 
COBB 
Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to 
postwar British painters. 
He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gl oves. 
COBB 
Would you sit down? 
Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingba ck chair. 
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE a nd kneels 
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him. 
MAL 
Tell me... 
Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS. 
MAL 
Do the children miss me? 
Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly tou ch Mal's 
ankle. He looks up at her. 6. COBB 
You can't imagine. 
Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his fee t, letting 
out the rope as he moves back to the window. 
MAL 
What're you doing? 
Cobb tosses the rope outy 
COBB 
Getting some air. 
He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the cha ir, with 
Mal on it, holds. 
COBB 
Stay seated. Please. 
And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open win dow. 
EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. H e stops at

from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dia l, pulls 
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it i nto his 
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVE LOPE. 
LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes. 
SAITO (O.S.) 
Turn around. 
Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next  to him is 
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb. 
MAL 
The gun, Dom. 
Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outsidey two GUARDS drag 
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.
MAL 
Please. 
Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long t able, then 
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to res t HALFWAY 
down the length or the table. 
SAITO 
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb. 
Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the  
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, h ands 
raised. 
COBB 
Did she  tell you, or have you known 
all along? 
SAITO 
That you're here to steal from me? 
(beat) 
Or that we're actually asleep? 
Arthur gives Cobb an Iytoldyyouyso look. 
SAITO 
I want to know who your employer 
is. 
Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple. 8. COBB 
No point threatening him in a 
dream. 
MAL 
That depends on what you're 
threatening. Killing him would just 
wake him up... but pain? Pain is in 
the mind... 
Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the legy Ar thur 
drops, SCREAMINGy Mal looks at Cobb, cold. 
MAL 
And, judging by the decor, we're in 
your  mind, aren't we, Arthur?

SAITO 
I bring the gun because not even my 
head of security knows this 
apartment. How did you  find it? 
Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING V IOLENCE. 
COBB 
Hard for a man in your position to 
keep a love nest totally secret... 
particularly when there's a married 
woman involved. 
SAITO 
She would never... 
COBB 
And yet, here we are. 
Saito is silent. 
COBB 
With a dilemma. 
SAITO 
You got what you came for.

Buenos Aires. I can lie low there. 
Maybe sniff out a job when things 
quiet down. You? 
ARTHUR 
Stateside. 
COBB 
(wistful) ) 
'Course. Send my regards. 
Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic. 
EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD y NIGHT 
The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and A rthur 
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the 
leatherypadded interior. He freezes. 20. INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD y CONTINUOUS 
Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against 
the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Co bb. 
SAITO 
He sold you out. Thought to come to 
me and bargain for his life... 
Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN. 
SAITO 
So I offer you the satisfaction. 
COBB 
That's not how I deal with things. 
SAITO 
Would you work with him again? 
Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the 
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper 
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad. 
COBB 
What will you do to him? 
SAITO 
Nothing. But I can't speak for your 
friends from Cobol Engineering. 
Saito looks out at the city slipping by. 
COBB 
What do you want from us? 
SAITO 
Inception. 
Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is pokeryfaced. 
SAITO 
Is it possible? 
ARTHUR 
Of course not. 
SAITO 
If you can steal an idea from 
someone's mind, why can't you plant 
one there instead? 
ARTHUR 
Okay, here's planting an idea: I 
say to you, "Don't think about 
elephants." 21. 
(MORE) (Saito nods) 
What are you thinking about? 
SAITO 
Elephants. 
ARTHUR 
Right. But it's not your idea 
because you know I gave it to you. 
SAITO 
You could plant it subconsciouslyy 
ARTHUR 
The subject's mind can always trace 
the genesis of the idea. True 
inspiration is impossible to fake. 
COBB 
No, it isn't. 
SAITO 
Can you do it? 
COBB 
I won't do it. 
SAITO 
In exchange, I'll give you the 
information you were paid to steal. 
COBB 
Are you giving me a choice? Because 
I can find my own way to square 
things with Cobol. 
SAITO 
Then you do have a choice. 
COBB 
And I choose to leave. 
EXT. AIRFIELD y MOMENTS LATER 
The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET. 
INT. HELICOPTER y CONTINUOUS 
Saito indicates the plane. 
SAITO 
Tell the crew where you want to go, 
they'll file the plan en route. 
Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for t he door. 22. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) SAITO 
Mr. Cobb...? There is one other 
thing I could offer you. 
(Cobb stops) 
How would you like to go home? To 
America. To your children. 
Cobb turns back to Saito. 
COBB 
You can't fix that. Nobody could. 
SAITO 
Just like inception. 
Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm. 
ARTHUR 
Cobb, come ony 
COBB 
How complex is the idea? 
SAITO 
Simple enough. 
COBB 
No idea's simple when you have to 
plant it in someone else's mind. 
SAITO 
My main competitor is an old man in 
poor health. His son will soon 
inherit control of the corporation. 
I need him to decide to break up 
his father's empire. Against his 
own selfyinterest. 
ARTHUR 
Cobb, we should walk away from 
this. 
COBB 
If I were to do it. If I could do 
it... how do I know you can 
deliver? 
SAITO 
You don't. But I can. So do you 
want to take a leap of faith, or 
become an old man, filled with 
regret, waiting to die alone? 
Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods. 23. SAITO 
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And 
choose your people more wisely. 
INT. PRIVATE JET y LATER 
Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, an gry. 
ARTHUR 
I know how much you want to go homey 
COBB 
(sharp) 
No, you don't. 
ARTHUR 
But this can't be done. 
COBB 
It can. You just have to go deep 
enough. 
ARTHUR 
You don't know that!y 
COBB 
I've done it before. 
Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window. 
ARTHUR 
Did it work? 
COBB 
(quiet) 
Yes. 
ARTHUR 
Who did you do it to? 
Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs. 
ARTHUR 
So why are we headed to Paris? 
COBB 
We're going to need a new 
architect. 
INT. GREAT HALL, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE y MORNING 
Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture  hall: no 
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over pap erwork. 24. INT. LECTURE HALL y CONTINUOUS 
COBB (O.S.) 
You never did like your office. 
PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cob b. 
MILES 
No space to think in that broom 
cupboard. 
Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows. 
MILES 
Is it safe for you to be here? 
COBB 
Extradition between France and the 
U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare. 
MILES 
I think they'd find a way to make 
it work in your case. 
Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag. 
COBB 
Can you take these back for the 
kids? 
MILES 
It'll take more than the occasional 
stuffed animal to convince those 
children they still have a father. 
COBB 
I know. I thought you could talk to 
Marie about bringing them on 
vacation. Somewhere I could meety 
MILES 
Why would she listen to me? 
COBB 
You were married for twenty years. 
MILES 
She blames me as much as you. 
COBB 
Doesn't she understand that my kids 
need me? 25. MILES 
Yes, she does. We all do. Go back 
and face the music, Dom. Explain 
what Mal did. 
COBB 
Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never 
understand− they'd lock me up and 
throwaway the key. Or worse. 
MILES 
You think what you're doing now is 
helping your case? 
COBB 
Lawyers don't pay for themselves. 
This is what I have. This is what 
you taught me. 
MILES 
I never taught you to be a thief. 
COBB 
No, you taught me to navigate other 
people's minds. But after what 
happened with Mal there weren't a 
whole lot of legitimate ways for me 
to use that skill. 
Miles looks at Cobb. 
MILES 
Why did you come here, Dom? 
Cobb shifts slightly. 
COBB 
I found a way home. A job. For 
powerful people. If I pull it off, 
I can get back to my family. But I 
need help. 
Miles realizes something. 
MILES 
My God. You're here to corrupt one 
of my brightest and best. 
COBB 
If you have someone good enough, 
you have to let them decide for 
themselves. You know what I'm 
offeringy 
MILES 
Money? 26. COBB 
No, not just money: the chance to 
build cathedrals, entire citiesy 
things that have never existed, 
things that couldn't exist in the 
real world... 
MILES 
Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects 
are supposed to make those dreams 
real. 
COBB 
That's not what you used to say. 
You told me that in the real world 
I'd be building attic conversions 
and gas stations. You said that if 
I mastered the dreamyshare I'd have 
a whole new way of creating and 
showing people my creations. You 
told me it would free me. 
Miles looks at Cobb, sad. 
MILES 
And I'm sorry. I was wrong. 
COBB 
No, you weren't. Your vision was a 
vision of pure creativity. It's 
where we took it that was wrong. 
MILES 
And now you want me to let someone 
else follow you into fantasy. 
COBB 
They won't actually come on the 
job, they'll just design the levels 
and teach them to the dreamers. 
MILES 
Design them yourself. 
COBB 
Mal won't let me. 
Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled. 
MILES 
Come back to reality, Dom. Please. 
COBB 
You want to know what's real, 
Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting 
for their dad to come back. 27. 
(MORE) This jobythis last  jobyis how I get 
there. 
Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers. 
COBB 
I wouldn't be standing here if 
there were any other way. I can get 
home. But I need an architect who's 
as good as I was. 
Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides. 
MILES 
I've got someone better. 
INT. CORRIDOR y LATER 
Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a l ecture. 
MILES 
Ariadne... 
A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE . 
MILES 
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb. 
She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand. 
ARIADNE 
Pleased to meet you. 
MILES 
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb 
has a job offer to discuss with 
you. 
ARIADNE 
A work placement? 
COBB 
(smiles 
Not exactly. 
EXT. ROOFTOP, ÉCOLE D'ARCHITECTURE y MOMENTS LATER 
Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Pari s. She 
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of  GRAPH 
PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sand wich. 
COBB 
A test. 28. 
COBB (CONT'D) ARIADNE 
(mouth full) 
Aren't you going to tell me 
anything? 
COBB 
Before I describe the job, I have 
to know you could do it. 
ARIADNE 
Why? 
COBB 
It's not, strictly speaking, legal. 
Ariadne raises her eyebrows. 
COBB 
You have two minutes to draw a maze 
that takes me one minute to solve. 
Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his wa tch. 
COBB 
Go. 
She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze. 
COBB 
Stop. 
Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances a t the pad, 
then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is 
taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad  back. 
COBB 
Again. 
She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING... 
COBB 
Stop. 
She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solve s the 
puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls. 
COBB 
You'll have toy 
She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it 
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of t he back. 
Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's 
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentri c rings. 
Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the  pen, 
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods. 29. COBB 
(working the maze) 
More like it. 
EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS y DAY 
Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper. 
INT. WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks o pen. 
Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly. 
INT. SAME y LATER 
Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the roo m. He 
erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpa cking 
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS... 
EXT. PARISIAN CAFE y DAY 
Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table. 
COBB 
They say we only use a fraction of 
the true potential of our brains... 
but they're talking about when 
we're awake . While we dream, the 
mind performs wonders. 
ARIADNE 
Such as? 
COBB 
How do you imagine a building? You 
consciously create each aspect, 
puzzling over it in stages... But 
sometimes, when your imagination 
flies y
ARIADNE 
I'm discovering  it. 
COBB 
Exactly. Genuine inspiration. 
Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cl oth. 
COBB 
In a dream your mind continuously  
does that... 
Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows. 30. COBB 
It creates and perceives a world 
simultaneously . So well that you 
don't feel your brain doing the 
creating. That's why we can shorty 
circuit the process... 
ARIADNE 
How? 
COBB 
By taking over the creating part. 
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows. 
COBB 
This is where you come in. You 
build the world of the dream. We 
take the subject into that dream, 
and let him £111 it with his 
subconscious 
ARIADNE 
But are you trying to fool him that 
the dream is actually real life? 
COBB 
(nods) 
While we're in there, We don't want 
him to realize he's dreaming. 
ARIADNE 
How could I ever get enough detail 
to Convince him that it's real? 
COBB 
Our dreams reel real while we're in 
them . It's only when we wake up we 
realize things were strange, 
Ariadne gestures around themy 
ARIADNE 
But all the textures of real lifey 
the stone, the fabric. cars... 
people ... your mind can't create 
all this. 
COBB 
It does. Every time you dream. Let 
me ask you a question: You never 
remember the beginning of your 
dreams, do you? You just turn up in 
the middle of what's going on. 31. ARIADNE 
I guess. 
COBB 
So... how did we end up at this 
restaurant? 
ARIADNE 
We came here from... 
Ariadne trails off, confused. 
COBB 
How did we get here? Where are we? 
Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins. 
ARIADNE 
Oh my God. We're dreaming .
Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING. 
COBB 
Stay calm. We're actually asleep in 
the workshop. This is your first 
lesson in shared dreaming, 
remember? 
Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACESy 
The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IM PLODING

CUT TO: 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
Ariadne JOLTS awake. 
COBB (O.S.) 
Because it's never just  a dream. 
Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sittin g in the 
lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them. 32. COBB 
And a face full of glass hurts like 
hell, doesn't it? While we're in 
it, it's real. 
ARTHUR 
That's why the military developed 
dream sharingya training program 
where soldiers could strangle, stab 
and shoot each other, then wake up. 
ARIADNE 
How did architects get involved? 
COBB 
Someone had to design the dreams. 
(to Arthur) 
Let's go another five minutesy 
ARIADNE 
We were only asleep for five 
minutes? We talked for an hour at 
least... 
COBB 
When you dream, your mind functions 
more quickly, so time seems to pass 
more slowly. 
ARTHUR 
Five minutes in the real world 
gives you an hour in the dream. 
COBB 
Let's see how much trouble you can 
cause in five minutes. 
And wey 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET y DAY 
Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Co bb looks 
around at the street, the cafe, approving. 
COBB 
It's good. You've got the cafe, the 
layout... you forgot the book shop 
but pretty much everything else is 
here. 
Ariadne looks at the passersyby. 
ARIADNE 
Who are the people? 33. COBB 
They’re projections of my 
subconscious. 
ARIADNE 
Yours? 
COBB 
Surey you  are the dreamer, I am the 
subject. My subconscious populates 
your world. That's one way we get 
at a subject's thoughtsyhis mind 
creates the people, so we can 
literally talk  to his subconscious. 
ARIADNE 
How else do you do it? 
COBB 
Architecture. Build a bank vault or 
a jail, something secure, and the 
subject's mind will fill it with 
information he's trying to protect. 
ARIADNE 
Then you break in and steal it. 
COBB 
Exactly. 
Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street. 
ARIADNE 
I love the concrete sense of thingsy 
(stamps foot) 
Real weight, you know? I thought a 
dream space would be all about the 
visual, but it's the feel  of 
things. Question is, what happens 
as you start to mess with 
physics... 
She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts t o BEND IN 
HALF− the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until  they form 
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING 
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or d own) at 
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watch es her 
excitement. 
ARIADNE 
It's something, isn't it? 
COBB 
(quiet) 
Yes. It is. 34. As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the 
projections STARING at her. 
ARIADNE 
Why are they looking at me? 
COBB 
Because you're changing things. My 
subconscious feels  that someone 
else is creating the world. The 
more you change things, the quicker 
the projections converge on you. 
ARIADNE 
Converge? 
COBB 
They feel the foreign nature of the 
dreamer, and attackylike white 
blood cells fighting an infection. 
ARIADNE 
They're going to attack us? 
COBB 
Just you, actually. 
They walk along the street to where it joins the ne xt 
gravitational plane. They step up onto the differen t plane 
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadn e 
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and sh e leads 
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pi llars 
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from th e jetty. 
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed. 
COBB 
It's beautiful... but if you keep 
on changing things... 
People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Severa l of them 
BUMP her shoulder as they pass. 
ARIADNE 
Mind telling your subconscious to 
take it easy? 
COBB 
That’s why it’s called sub conscious. 
I don’t control it. 
The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.
COBB 
Arched stone, iron pillars... 
it's... 35. Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering. 
INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smili ng, 
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same brid ge. 
COBB 
I know this bridge. This place is 
real− 
(serious) 
You didn't imagine it, you 
remembered  it... 
ARIADNE 
(nods) 
I cross it every day on my way to 
the college. 
COBB 
Never recreate places from your 
memory. Always imagine new places. 
ARIADNE 
You have to draw from what you knowy 
COBB 
(tense) 
Use piecesya streetlamp, 
phonebooths, a type of brickynot 
whole areas. 
Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude... 
ARIADNE 
Why not? 
COBB 
Because building dreams out of your 
own memories is the surest way to 
lose your grip on what's real and 
what's a dream. 
ARIADNE 
Did that happen to you? 
Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Aria dne. 
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile. 
COBB 
Look, this isn't about me y
Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to himy 
ARIADNE 
Is that why you need me to build 
your dreams? 36. A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shouldery

Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd

ARTHUR 
It's okay. 
ARIADNE 
Why couldn’t I wake? 
ARTHUR 
The only way to wake from inside 
the dream is to die. 
Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes o ut. 
COBB 
She'll need a totem. 
ARIADNE 
What? 
ARTHUR 
Some kind of personal icon. A small 
object that you can always have 
with you, and that no one else 
knows, 
Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furio us. He 
heads to the bathroom. 37. ARIADNE 
That's some subconscious you've 
got, Cobb. 
(calls after him) 
She's a real charmer! 
ARTHUR 
Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb. 
ARIADNE 
(surprised) 
She's his wife? 
Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes. 
ARTHUR 
So. A totem. You need something 
small, potentially heavy... 
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on  the 
marble counter... 
INT. WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled. 
ARIADNE 
Like a coin? 
ARTHUR 
Too common. You need something that 
has a weight or movement that only 
you  know. 
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, beco ming more 
and more ECCENTRIC... 
INT. WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
ARIADNE 
What’s yours? 
Arthur holds out a DIE. 
ARTHUR 
A loaded die. 
Ariadne reaches for ity Arthur snatches sit awayy 38. ARTHUR 
I can’t let you handle it. That’s 
the point. No one else can know the 
weight or balance of it. 
ARIADNE 
Why? 
ARTHUR 
So when you examine your totem... 
INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb’s spinning top WOBBLES OVER. 
ARTHUR (O.S.) 
You know, beyond a doubt, that 
you’re not in someone else’s dream. 
Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a li feline. 
INT. WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne thinks this over. 
ARIADNE 
That’s not an issue for me. 
ARTHUR 
Why not? 
ARIADNE 
Arthur, maybe you can’t see what’s 
going on, maybe you don’t want to. 
But Cobb’s got problems he’s tried 
to bury down there. I’m not going 
to open my mind to someone like 
that. 
Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away. 
COBB (O.S.) 
She’ll be back. 
Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom door way. 
COBB 
I’ve never seen anyone pick it up 
so fast. And one reality won’t be 
enough for her now. When she comes 
back, get her building mazes. 
ARTHUR 
Where will you be? 39. COBB 
I’ve got to talk to Eames. 
ARTHUR 
Eames? But he’s in Mombasa. Cobol’s 
backyard. 
COBB 
Necessary risk. 
ARTHUR 
There are plenty of other thieves. 
COBB 
We don’t just need a thief. We need 
a forger. 
INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA y DAY 
Crowded, bustling, smokeyfilled. a westerner (40’s) , shabby 
suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES.  He 
FIDDLES with his last two chips. 
COBB (O.S.) 
Rub them against each other all you 
like, they’re not going to breed. 
Eames looks up to see Cobb. 
EAMES 
You never know. 
Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are roll ed... 
COBB 
Drink? 
Eames loses. 
EAMES 
You’re buying. 
Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two  stacks of 
chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. C obb pulls 
one off the top, squints at the embossed name. 
COBB 
You’re spelling hasn’t improved. 
Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier. 
EAMES 
Piss off. 
COBB 
How’s your handwriting? 40. Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb. 
EAMES 
Versatile. 
INT. STREET, MOMBASA y CONTINUOUS 
Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street. 
EAMES 
Word is, you’re not welcome in 
these parts. 
COBB 
Yeah? 
EAMES 
There’s a price on your head from 
Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one, 
actually. 
COBB 
You wouldn’t sell me out. 
Eames looks at Cobb, offended. 
EAMES 
‘Course I would. 
COBB 
(smiles) 
Not when you hear what I’m selling. 
EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE y LATER 
A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eam es pours. 
COBB 
Inception. 
Eames’s glass stops halfway to his mouth. 
COBB 
Don’t bother telling me it’s 
impossible. 
EAMES 
It’s perfectly possible. Just 
bloody difficult. 
COBB 
That’s what I keep saying to 
Arthur. 41. EAMES 
Arthur? You’re still working with 
that stickyinytheymud? 
COBB 
He’s a good point man. 
EAMES 
The best. But he has no 
imagination. If you’re going to 
perform inception, you need 
imagination. 
COBB 
You’ve done it before? 
EAMES 
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the 
idea in place, but it didn’t take. 
COBB 
You didn’t plant it deep enough? 
EAMES 
It’s not just about depth. You need 
the simplest version of the ideay 
the one that will grow naturally in 
the subject’s mind. Subtle art. 
COBB 
That’s why I’m here. 
EAMES 
What’s the idea you need to plant? 
COBB 
We want the heir to a major 
corporation to break up his 
father’s empire. 
EAMES 
See, right there you’ve got various 
political motivations, antiy 
monopolistic sentiment and  so 
forth. But all that stuff’s at the 
mercy of the subject’s prejudicey 
you have to go to the basic. 
COBB 
Which is? 
EAMES 
The relationship with the father. 
(downs drink) 
Do you have a chemist? 42. Cobb shakes his head. 
EAMES 
There’s a man here. Yusuf. He 
formulates his own versions of the 
compounds. 
COBB 
Let’s go see him. 
EAMES 
Once you’ve lost your tail. 
(Cobb reacts) 
Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in 
about two minutes after we did. 
COBB 
Cobol Engineering? 
EAMES 
They pretty much own Mombasa. 
Cobb glances over the balcony. 
COBB 
Run interference. We’ll meet 
downstairs in half an hour. 
EAMES 
Back here? 
COBB 
Last place they’d expect. 
Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Bus inessman. 
EAMES 
Freddy! 
The Businessman looks up, awkward. 
EAMES 
Freddy Simmonds, it is  you! 
Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING H ARD into 
the midst of the crowd on the street below. 
EAMES 
(looks harder) 
Oh. No, it isn’t. 
EXT. STREET, MOMBASA y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowdy faces PEER a t himy he

Yes? 
SECOND BUSINESSMAN

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past  himy 
The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Co bb's wake, 
DIVES after himy Cobb RACES headlong through tight 
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the l ocals... 
He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the ta bles...

SAITO 
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb? 
COBB 
(jumping in) 
What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. 
Saito? 
SAITO 
I have to protect my investment. 
EXT. COFFEE HOUSE y MOMENTS LATER 
Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cob b beckons 
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to  Cobb. 
EAMES 
This is your idea of losing a tail? 44. COBB 
(shrugs) 
Different tail. 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A  small 
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there. 
ARTHUR 
He said you'd be back. 
ARIADNE 
I tried not to come. 
ARTHUR 
But there's nothing else quite like 
it. 
ARIADNE 
No paper, no pens... nothing 
between you and raw, direct 
creation. 
Arthur picks up his mechanism. 
ARTHUR 
Shall we take a look at paradoxical 
architecture? 
Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and wey 
CUT TO: 
INT. PENROSE STEPS y LATER 
Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a larg e glass 
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex. 
ARTHUR 
You're going to have to master a 
few tricks if you're going to build 
three complete dream levels. 
A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass... 
ARIADNE 
What sort of tricks? 
They take a tight turn and continue down the next f light. 
ARTHUR 
In a dream, you can cheat 
architecture into impossible 
shapes. 45. 
(MORE) That lets you create closed loops, 
like the Penrose Steps. The 
infinite staircase. 
Ariadne FREEZESy THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STA RTED 
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering he r papers. 
Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of t he stairs. 
ARTHUR 
See... 
Arthur stops her gentlyy they are on the highest st ep, with a 
LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the  drop. 
ARTHUR 
Paradox. A closed loop like this 
helps you disguise the boundaries 
of the dream you've created. 
ARIADNE 
How big do the levels have to be? 
ARTHUR 
Anything from the floor of a 
building, to an entire city. But it 
has to be complicated enough for us 
to hide from the projections. 
ARIADNE 
A maze. 
ARTHUR 
And the better the mazey 
ARIADNE 
The longer we have before the 
projections catch us. 
Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur . 
ARIADNE 
My subconscious seems polite 
enough. 
ARTHUR 
You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one 
likes to see someone else messing 
around in their mind. 
ARIADNE 
Cobb can't build anymore, can he? 46. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) ARTHUR 
I don't know if he can't, but he 
won't. He thinks it's safer if he 
doesn't know the layouts. 
ARIADNE 
Why? 
ARTHUR 
He won't tell me. I think it's Mal. 
I think she's getting stronger. 
ARIADNE 
His exywife? 
ARTHUR 
She's not his ex. 
ARIADNE 
They're still together? 
Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle. 
ARTHUR 
No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What 
you see in there is just his 
projection of her. 
ARIADNE 
What was she like in real life? 
ARTHUR 
(quiet) 
She was lovely. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA y DAY 
Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOC UMENTS. As 
Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames. 
SAITO 
Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the 
Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate. 
He's spent his whole life being 
groomed as successorybreaking up 
his father's empire will take a 
radical shift in his thinking. 
COBB 
What's your problem with Fischer? 
SAITO 
That's not your concern. 47. COBB 
This isn't the usual corporate 
espionage, Mr. Saito. This is 
inception . The seed of the idea we 
plant will grow in this man's mind. 
It'll change him. It might even 
come to define him. 
Saito looks at Cobb. 
SAITO 
My sources suggest you might not 
have always been so cautious. 
COBB 
Then you need new sources, Mr. 
Saito. 
Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs. 
SAITO 
Fischer Morrow has the regulators 
in their pockets. We're the last 
company standing between them and 
total energy dominance and we can 
no longer compete. Soon they'll 
control the energy supply of half 
the world. They'll be able to 
blackmail governments, dictate 
policy. In effect, they become a 
new superpower. The world needs 
Robert Fischer to change his mind. 
EAMES 
That's where we come in. How's 
Robert Fischer's relationship to 
his father? 
SAITO 
Rumor is the relationship is 
complicated. 
COBB 
We'll need more than rumor, Mr. 
Saito. 
Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive ( 68). 
EAMES 
Can you get me access to him? 
Browning. Fischer senior's righty 
hand man. Fischer junior's 
godfather. 48. SAITO 
It should be possible. If you can 
get the right references. 
EAMES 
References are something of a 
specialty for me, Mr. Saito. 
EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA y LATER 
Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a d oorway. 
INT. STAIRWELL y CONTINUOUS 
Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dust y,          
wireyreinforced glass door which Eames pushes openy
INT. PHARMACY y CONTINUOUS 
Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty 
glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a 
portly 40yyearyold man rises from behind his desk, beckoning. 
This is YUSUF. 
YUSUF 
Come, come. 
Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb. 
YUSUF 
Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so 
very much about you. 
(indicates chairs) 
please. 
Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair. 
YUSUF 
Bloody cats. 
Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over th e glass 
bottles. None of them has a label. 
YUSUF 
You work using Somnacin, I think, 
Mr. Cobb? 
COBB 
You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf. 
Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.49. COBB 
(dubious) 
Somnacin? 
YUSUF 
(proudly) 
Yusuf's Somnacin. 
Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's no se. 
COBB 
As good as the real thing? 
Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended. 
YUSUF 
Better. 
Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling. 
YUSUF 
Binds the dreamers tight. Let's 
them dream as one. Makes it real. 
Of course, if you'd prefer, you 
could use Somnacin brand. If  you 
could explain to the international 
control council what you wanted it 
for. 
Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits. 
YUSUF 
You are seeking a chemist? 
(Cobb nods) 
To formulate compounds for a job? 
COBB 
And to come into the held with us. 
YUSUF 
I rarely go into the held, Mr. 
Cobb. 
COBB 
We need you there to tailor 
compounds to our particular 
requirements. 
YUSUF 
Which are? 
COBB 
Great depth. 
YUSUF 
A dream within a dream? Two levels? 50. COBB 
Three. 
YUSUF 
Not possible. That many dreams 
within dreams would be too 
unstable. 
COBB 
I've done it before. You just have 
to add a sedative. 
YUSUF 
A powerful  sedative. How many team 
members? 
COBB 
Five. 
SAITO 
Six. 
(to Cobb) 
The only way to know you've done 
the job is if I go in with you. 
COBB 
There's no room for tourists on 
these jobs, Mr. Saito. 
SAITO 
This time, it would seem there is. 
Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle. 
YUSUF 
Of course. I use it every day. 
Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liq uid 
inside. 
COBB 
For what? 
Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL 
DOOR. He STOPSy second thoughts. 
YUSUF 
Perhaps... you will not want to 
see. 
Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large k ey. 51. INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY y CONTINUOUS 
A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a slee ping 
occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BA LD MAN 
watches over them. 
EAMES 
(counting) 
Eighteen, twentyyall connected, 
bloody hell. 
YUSUF 
They come every day. To share the 
dream. 
Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to th e nearest 
bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP. 
The sleeper does not even stir. 
YUSUF 
See? Very stable. 
COBB 
How long do they dream? 
YUSUF 
Three, four hours. Every day. 
COBB 
How long in dream time? 
YUSUF 
With this compound... about forty 
hours. Each and every day. 
Saito surveys the room, appalled. 
SAITO 
Why do they do it? 
YUSUF 
Tell him, Mr. Cobb. 
COBB 
After a while... 
(looks at Saito) 
It becomes the only way you can 
dream. 
YUSUF 
Do you  still dream, Mr. Cobb? 
Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy. 
EAMES 
They come here every day to sleep? 52. ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.) 
No. 
Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondl y at his 
dreamers. 
ELDERLY BALD MAN 
They come to be woken  up... the 
dream has become their reality... 
The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb 's chest. 
ELDERLY BALD MAN 
And who are you  to say otherwise? 
Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cob b turns to 
Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle. 
COBB 
Let's see what you can do. 
INT. SAME y MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands  over him. 
As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the s ound of a 
FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and wey

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hardy INSERT CUT: 
A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, S MILING. 
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning  top. He 
tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the si nk, but it 
FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the doory Sait o is 
there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning  top. 53. SAITO 
Everything alright, Mr. Cobb? 
Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up hi s top. 
COBB 
Everything's fine. 
INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP y NIGHT 
Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it  over. 
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back th e felt on 
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its bas e. Tests 
the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.
INT. WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there , 
unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb. 
ARIADNE 
You're back. 
Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out. 
ARIADNE 
Are you going under on your own? 
COBB 
I justyI need to test some things. 
I didn't realize anyone was here. 
ARIADNE 
Just working on my totem. 
Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it. 
COBB 
Let me seey 
Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nod s. 
COBB 
You're learning. 
ARIADNE 
It's an elegant solution to keeping 
track of reality. Your invention? 
COBB 
No. Mal's. 
Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it. 54. COBB 
This one was hers. She'd spin it in 
a dream and it would never topple. 
Just spin and spin... 
ARIADNE 
Arthur told me she died. 
COBB 
She did. How are the mazes coming? 
Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.
ARIADNE 
Good. Each level relates to the 
part of the subject's subconscious 
we're trying to access. I'm making 
the bottom level a hospital, so 
that Fischer will bring his father 
therey 
COBB 
Don't tell me. Remember, you only 
want the dreamer to know the 
layout. 
ARIADNE 
Why's that so important? 
COBB 
In case one of us brings in part of 
our subconscious. You wouldn't want 
any projections knowing the layout. 
ARIADNE 
In case you  bring Mal in. 
Cobb says nothing. 
ARIADNE 
You won't build yourself because if 
you know the maze, then she knows 
it. And she'd sabotage the 
operation. You can't keep her out, 
can you? 
Cobb says nothing. 
ARIADNE 
Do the others know? 
COBB 
No. 55. ARIADNE 
You have to warn them if it's 
getting worsey 
COBB 
(gentle) 
I didn't say it's getting worse. 
Look, Ariadne, I need them for this 
job. I need you for this job. 
Without your help, I'll never get 
back to my children. And that's all 
I can care about right now. 
ARIADNE 
Why can't you go home, Cobb? 
Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say. 
COBB 
They think I killed her. 
ARIADNE 
How did she die? 
Cobb thinks. 
INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at C obb. Now 
we see CobbL SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEG GINGL 
COBB 
Thank you. 
ARIADNE 
For what? 
COBB 
Not asking whether I did. 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room, 
looking at FILES. Cobb presides. 
COBB 
The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to 
the Australian energy conglomerate, 
Fischer Morrow. 
Cobb opens a large presentation pad. 
COBB (reads aloud) 
"I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S 
EMPIRE." 
Cobb turns to the team. 56. COBB 
An idea Robert Fischer's conscious 
mind would never accept. We have to 
plant it deep in his subconscious. 
ARTHUR 
How deep? 
COBB 
Three levels down. 
ARTHUR 
A dream within a dream within a 
dream? Is that even possible? 
COBB 
Yes. It is. 
COBB 
Now, the subconscious motivates 
through emotion, not reason, so we 
have to translate the idea into an 
emotional  concept. 
ARTHUR 
How do you translate a business 
strategy into an emotion? 
COBB 
That's what we have to figure out. 
Robert and his father have a tense 
relationship. Worse, even, than the 
gossip columns have suggested... 
EAMES 
Do you play on that? Suggest 
breaking up his father's company as 
a 'screw you' to the old man? 
COBB 
No. Positive emotion trumps 
negative emotion every time. We 
yearn for people to be reconciled, 
for catharsis. We need positive  
emotional logic. 
Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board. 
EAMES 
Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT 
I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT 
FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS." 
COBB 
That might work. 57. ARTHUR 
Might? We'll have to do better than 
that. 
EAMES 
Thanks for the contribution, 
Arthur. 
ARTHUR 
Forgive me for wanting a little 
specificity, Eames. 
COBB 
Inception's not about specificity. 
When we get inside his head, we're 
going to have to work with what we 
find. 
Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And wey 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS y DAY 
The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersecti on. 
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography. 
EAMES 
We could split the idea into 
emotional triggers, and use one on 
each level. 
COBB 
How do you mean? 
EAMES 
On the top level, we open up his 
relationship with his father.... 
Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY 
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level 
down we've accessed his ambition 
and selfyesteem. We feed him: "I 
WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF." 
Then, the bottom level, we bring 
out the emotional big guns... 
COBB 
"MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE 
HIM." 
EAMES 
That could do it. 
ARTHUR 
How do you produce these emotional 
triggers? 58. EAMES 
I forge each emotional concept in 
the style and manner of Peter 
Browning, a key figure in Fischer's 
emotional life. 
Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view. 
ARTHUR 
Are those yours? 
Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf. 
ARTHUR 
Yusuf? 
YUSUF 
Yup. Sorry. 
COBB 
Suppress them. We don't bring our 
own projections into the dreamywe 
let Fischer's subconscious supply 
the people. 
EAMES 
Saito, when do I get to see 
Browning? 
SAITO 
You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday. 
We've arranged for you to spend 
several days... 
INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE y DAY 
Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are  piled 
high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors. 
SAITO (V.O.) 
...as part of a consulting 
litigation team working for 
Browning. 
BROWNING 
I'm not smelling settlement hereywe 
take them down. 
LAWYER 
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's 
policy is always one of avoiding 
litigationy 
Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL. 59. BROWNING 
Shall we relay your concerns 
directly to Maurice? 
Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner  office. 
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Law yer intoy 
INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE y CONTINUOUS 
The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED wher e the desk 
should be. Browning addresses a figure at the windo w. ROBERT 
FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted. 
BROWNING 
How is he? 
Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he g lances at 
his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently. 
BROWNING 
I don't want to bother him 
unnecessarily but I know hey 
FATHER 
Robert! I've told you to keep out 
the damn!y 
MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedsid e table. A 
NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve  a FRAMED 
PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broke n glassy a 
YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of 
the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on  it. 
BROWNING 
Must be a cherished memory of hisy 
FISCHER 
I put it by his bed. He hasn't even 
noticed. 
BROWNING 
Robert, we have to talk about a 
power of attorney. I know this is 
hard for you, but it's important 
that we start to think about the 
futurey 
FISCHER 
Not now, Uncle Peter. 
Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time. 
EAMES (V.O.) 
The vultures are circling. The 
sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the 
stronger Peter Browning becomes... 60. Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move . 
INT. BATHROOM y DAY 
Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake  hands... 
EAMES (V.O.) 
I've had time to learn Browning's 
physical presence and mannerisms... 
In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK. 
INT. WORKSHOP y CONTINUOUS 
EAMES 
Now, in the dream, I can impersonate 
Browning and suggest the concepts to 
Fischer's conscious mind... 
(draws a diagram) 
Then we take Fischer down another 
level and his own subconscious 
feeds it right back to him. 
ARTHUR 
(impressed) 
So he gives himself  the idea. 
EAMES 
Precisely. That's the only way        
to make it stick. It has to seem 
selfLgenerated. 
ARTHUR 
Eames, I'm impressed. 
EAMES 
Your condescension, as always, is 
much appreciated, Arthur. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY y DAY 
The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby , 
debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby. 
EAMES 
He's not scheduled for surgery, no 
dental, nothing. 
COBB 
I thought he had some knee thing? 
EAMES 
Nothing they'd put him under for. 
Besides, we need a good ten hours. 61. SAITO 
Sydney to Los Angeles. 
They turn to Saito. 
SAITO 
Twelve hours and fortyyfive  
minutesyone of the longest flights 
in the world. He makes it every two 
weeks... 
EXT. AIRFIELD y DAY 
Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks acr oss the 
tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by tw o aides. 
COBB (V.O.) 
Surely he flies private? 
SAITO (V.O.) 
Not if there were unexpected 
maintenance with his plane. 
Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY y DAY 
Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over. 
ARTHUR 
It'd have to be a 747. 
COBB 
Why? 
ARTHUR 
On a 747 the pilots are up above, 
first class is in the nose so 
nobody walks through the cabin. 
We'd have to buyout the whole 
cabin, and the first class flight 
attendanty 
SAITO 
We bought the airline. 
Everyone turns to Saito. 
SAITO 
It seemed... neater. 
COBB 
Neater, huh? 
(gets to his feet) 
Well, now we have ten uninterrupted 
hours. 62. 
(MORE) (to Ariadne) 
Nice lobby, by the way. 
And wey 
CUT TO: 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussi on. 
ARTHUR 
My question is how we go down three 
layers with enough stability. Three 
layers down a little turbulence is 
gonna translate into an earthquake . 
The dreams are gonna collapse with 
the slightest disturbance. 
Yusuf clears his throat. 
YUSUF 
Sedation. For sleep stable enough to 
create three layers of dreaming... 
INT. MAKESHIFT LAB y DAY 
Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair. 
YUSUF (V.O.) 
We will have to combine it with an 
extremely powerful sedative.... 
Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir. 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek. 
YUSUF 
The compound we'll be using to 
share the dream is an advanced 
Somnacin derivative. It creates a 
very clear connection between 
dreamers, whilst actually 
accelerating brain function. 
CUT TO: 
COBB 
Buying us more time in each level. 
YUSUF 
Brain function in the dream will be 
about twenty times normal. 63. 
COBB (CONT'D) 
(MORE) And when you go into a dream within 
that dream the effect is 
compounded. 
ARIADNE 
How much time? 
YUSUF 
Three  dreams... that's ten hours, 
times twenty, times twenty, times 
twenty... 
EAMES 
Math was never my strong suit. 
COBB 
It's basically a week one layer 
down, six months two layers downy 
ARIADNE 
And ten years in the third level. 
Who wants to spend ten years in a 
dream? 
YUSUF 
Depends on the dream. 
EAMES 
It's not going to take us long to 
crack Fischer open once we get 
going. We'll be out in a couple 
days, max. 
ARTHUR 
How do we get out once we've made 
the plant? 
(to Cobb) 
I hope you've got something a 
little more elegant in mind than 
shooting me in the head like last 
time. 
Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb . 
COBB 
A kick. 
ARIADNE 
What's a kick? 
Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS  ity 
Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balancey 
EAMES 
That, Ariadne, would be a kick. 64. 
YUSUF (CONT'D) COBB 
That feeling of falling which snaps 
you awake. We use that to jolt 
ourselves awake once we're done. 
ARTHUR 
But how are we going to feel that 
through the sedation? 
YUSUF 
That's the clever part. I customize 
the sedative... 
INT. MAKESHIFT LAB y DAY 
Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a ch air. 
YUSUF (O.S.) 
To leave inner ear function 
unimpaired... 
Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's cha ir 
backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES  OPENING 
just before he HITS the floor. 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
Arthur thinks, nodding slowly. 
YUSUF 
That way, however deep the sleep, the 
sleeper will still feel falling... 
INT. MAKESHIFT LAB y DAY 
Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side  ... 
YUSUF (V.O.) 
Or tipping... 
Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKEy 
INT. WORKSHOP y DAY 
Arthur thinks this through. 
ARTHUR 
Even that won't cut through three  
layers of deep sleep. 
COBB 
The trick is to devise a kick for 
each level, then synchronize  them 
to get a snap that penetrates all 
three layers. 65. Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it. 
ARTHUR 
We can use the musical countdown to 
synchronize the different kicks. 
INT. WORKSHOP y NIGHT 
Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is  lying on 
one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechani sm. 
Ariadne stands over him. Watching. 
She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, c hecking 
the dials as she injects the needle cap into her ar m, and wey 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR y DAY 
Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots th e "B." The 
elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill aty 
INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM y DAY 
Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the r oom, 
considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is  a doll's 
house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Insid e is a 
SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES hery s he turns, 
looking through a doorway into another room... 
INT. LIVING ROOM y CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal tal king, 
arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's ha ir, trying 
to convince him. We hear snatches of conversationy 
MAL 
You remember when you asked me to 
marry you? 
COBB 
Of course... 
MAL 
You said you had a dream... 
COBB 
That we'd grow old together. 
MAL 
And we can. You know how to find 
me... you know what you have to do. 
Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Co bb's eyesy 
gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.  66. FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne , moves 
towards her, leaving Mal. 
COBB 
You shouldn't be in here. 
Cobb guides her back into the elevator. 
ARIADNE 
I wanted to know what "tests" you 
need to do on your own every night. 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR y DAY 
Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. Th e elevator 
RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH st retching 
off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits  on the 
sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, aw ay from 
us, building a SANDCASTLE. 
ARIADNE 
Why do you do this to yourself? 
COBB 
This is the only way I can still 
dream. 
ARIADNE 
Is it so important to dream? 
Cobb stares at his family. 
COBB 
In my dreams... we're still together. 
The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN A WAY. 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR y CONTINUOUS 
The elevator descends. 
ARIADNE 
But these aren't just dreams, are 
they? They're memories. You said 
never to use memories. 
COBB 
And I shouldn't. 
ARIADNE 
You're keeping her alive. 
COBB 
No. 67. ARIADNE 
You can't let her go. 
COBB 
No. These are moments I regret. 
Moments I turned into dreams so I 
could change them. 
Ariadne's fingers move across the buttonsy stop at the "B." 
ARIADNE 
What've you got buried down there 
that you regret? 
Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor but ton. 
COBB 
There's only one thing I need you 
to understand about me... 
INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE y MOMENTS LATER 
Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN i s there, 
standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF P APER. 
ARIADNE 
This is your house? 
COBB 
Mine and Mal's. 
ARIADNE 
Where is she? 
COBB 
She'd already died. 
The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHIL D'S SHOUTy 
Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden.  A small 
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his ha unches to 
look at something on the ground. 
COBB 
It's James. My boy. He's found 
something. Maybe a worm. 
A slightly older girl RUNS into view. 
COBB 
And there's Philippa. 
She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY F ROM US. 
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground. 68. COBB 
I thought about calling out, so 
they'd turn and smile those 
incredible smiles... but I'm out of 
timey 
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand. 
THIN MAN 
Right now. Or never, Cobb. 
Cobb nods, turns from the windowy 
COBB 
Then I panic that I'll always wish 
I'd seen them turn, that I can't 
waste this chance... 
Cobb TURNS BACK to call outy but the children RACE OFF... 
COBB 
But the moment's passed. And 
whatever I do, the dream's always 
the same... When I'm about to 
call... they run. 
Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FAC ES UNSEEN. 
COBB 
If I'm going to see their faces 
againyI've got to get back here in 
the real world... 
Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURN S. 
INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR y CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator star ts to 
DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors 
slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wa ll of 
freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the gr ill 
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the gril l, steps 
cautiously out intoy 
INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE y CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT) 
DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table, 
STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps 
forwardsy SMASH− she looks down to see that she has  kicked 
over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. Th e CURTAIN 
BILLOWS. 
MAL (O.S.) 
What are you doing here? 
Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there. 69. ARIADNE 
My name isy 
MAL 
I know who you are. What are you 
doing here? 
ARIADNE 
I don't know. Trying to understand. 
MAL 
How could you understand? Do you 
know what it is to be a lover? To 
be half of a whole? 
ARIADNE 
No. 
Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne... 
MAL 
I'll tell you a riddle. You're 
waiting for a train. A train that 
will take you far away. You know 
where you hope this train will take 
you, but you don't know for sure... 
Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over. 
MAL 
But... it doesn't matter . How can 
it not matter to you where that 
train will take you? 
COBB (O.S.) 
Because you'll be together. 
Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks a t him. 
MAL 
How could you bring her here , Dom? 
ARIADNE 
What is this place? 
COBB 
A hotel. We spent our anniversaries 
in this suite. 
ARIADNE 
What happened here? 
Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute.. . 70. INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevatory Mal THROWS he rself

COBB 
We can. We will. But I need you to 
stay here for nowy 
MAL 
YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!y 
Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to ris e. 
COBB 
I'll come back. I need you to stay 
here on your own for now. Just 
while I do this job. Then we can be 
togethery 
MAL 
WE'LL BE TOGETHERyYOU PROMISED!y 
Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. wey 
CUT TO: 
INT. WORKSHOP y NIGHT 
Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually f licker 
open. He sees her watching him. 
ARIADNE 
You think you can just build a 
prison of memories to lock her in? 
You think that's going to contain 
her? 
The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the d oorway. 
SAITO 
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney. 
COBB 
When's the funeral? 
SAITO 
Thursday. In Los Angeles. 71. COBB 
Robert'll accompany the body 
Tuesday at the outside. We have to 
move. 
Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him. 
ARIADNE 
(low) 
I'm coming with you. 
COBB 
No. I promised Miles. 
ARIADNE 
The team needs someone in there who 
understands what you're struggling 
with. If you don't want it to be me 
then you need to show Arthur what I 
just saw. 
Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito. 
COBB 
We need one more seat on the plane. 
INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY y DAY 
Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives 
beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded. 
COBB 
If I get on this plane and you 
haven't taken care of things... 
when we land I go to jail for the 
rest of my life. 
SAITO 
Complete the job en route, I make 
one phone call from the plane... 
you will have no trouble clearing 
immigration. 
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 y CONTINUOUS 
The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds hisy sees 
Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowl edge each 
other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window . Eames 
enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCK ING the 
passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, p atient, 
bag in hand, wearing black. 
EAMES 
Oh, sorry. 72. Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer B RUSH PAST. 
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cob b. Eames 
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer 's. 
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats . 
EXT. RUNWAY y MOMENTS LATER 
The 747 HURTLES down the runway. 
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 y MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to t he center 
of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark. 
Cobb unbuckles, stands. 
COBB 
Excuse me? 
Fischer looks up. 
FISCHER 
Yes? 
COBB 
I think this is yours... 
Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the pict ure to 
Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb ha nds 
Fischer the passport. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
Would you gentlemen care for a 
drink? 
FISCHER 
Water. 
COBB 
Same. 
Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passp ort. 
FISCHER 
Well, thank you. 
COBB 
No problem. Look, I couldn't help 
noticing your name. You're not 
related to Maurice  Fischer? 
Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless. 
FISCHER 
Actually, he was my father. 73. COBB 
I'm very sorry for your loss. He 
was an inspiring figure. 
The Flight Attendant brings their drinksy Cobb take s them. 
COBB 
Thanks. 
As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ...  a CLEAR 
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him. 
COBB 
To Maurice Fischer. 
(they drink) 
I'll leave you in peace. 
Fischer grants him a smile. 
EXT. 747 y LATER 
The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.
INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 y MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blankety lets it fall 
onto Fischer's heady Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP . Cobb 
SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlo cks a 
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the cu rtain. 
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHAN ISM CASE. 
Cobb and Arthur open the mechanismy uncoil the tube sy feed 
them around the window side of each of the seats. A rthur 
rolls up Fischer's cuffy PUSHES the needle cap into  Fischer's 
wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides t he tubes 
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat. 
Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the  case on 
Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the s yringes. 
The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON y closes

Couldn't you have peed before you 
went under? 
YUSUF 
Sorry. 
The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked. 
EAMES 
Bit too much free champagne before 
takeoff, Yusuf? 
YUSUF 
Ha bloody ha. 
COBB 
At least we know he'll be looking 
for a cab in this. 
INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS y CONTINU OUS 
Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves ar ound 
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB. 
COBB 
Brace yourselves. 
Cobb hits the gasy REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH.  The 
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's windowy
CABDRIVER 
Hey, asshole! Why don't you try 
driving without your thumb upy 
He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab . Both 
cars pull away.

Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back , brushing 
rain from his shoulders. 75. FISCHER 
Third and Market. Snappy. 
Eames JUMPS in from the other side. 
FISCHER 
What're you doing? 
EAMES 
Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe 
we could share. 
FISCHER 
Maybe not. 
Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun. 
FISCHER 
Great. 
Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and  tosses it 
at Eames. 
FISCHER 
(contemptuous) 
There's 500 dollars in there. And 
the wallet's worth more than that. 
For that you ought to at least drop 
me at my stop. 
Eames smiles at this. 
EAMES

COBB 
Arthur! Arthur what they 
Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat. 
COBB 
Oh, Christ. Is he dying? 77. ARTHUR 
I don't know. What happened back 
there? Where were you? 
COBB 
We were blocked by a freight train. 
ARTHUR 
(to Ariadne) 
Why would you put a train crossing 
in a downtown intersection? 
ARIADNE 
I didn't. 
COBB 
(snaps) 
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?! 
Those weren't regular projectionsy 
they'd been trained !
ARIADNE 
How could they be trained? 
ARTHUR 
Fischer's had an extractor teach 
his mind to defend itself. His 
subconscious is militarized. It 
should've shown on the researchy 
COBB 
So why the hell didn't it?! 
ARTHUR 
Calm down. 
COBB 
Don't tell me to calm downyyou were 
meant to check Fischer's background 
thoroughly. You can't make this 
kind of mistakeywe're not prepared 
for this kind of violencey 
ARTHUR 
Cobb, we've dealt with subysecurity 
before. We just have to be morey 
COBB 
This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur! 
(points at Saito) 
He's dying !
EAMES  
So we put him out of his misery. 78. Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over 
Saito. 
COBB 
No. 
EAMES 
He's in agony. Let's wake him upy 
Cobb GRABS Eames's arm. 
COBB 
No! 
(they lock eyes) 
It won't wake him up. 
EAMES 
What do you mean, it won't wake 
him? When you die in a dream you 
wake up. 
YUSUF 
Not from this. We're too heavily 
sedated to wake up that way. 
Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb. 
EAMES 
So what happens if one of us dies? 
COBB 
That person doesn't wake up. Their 
mind drops into Limbo. 
ARIADNE 
Limbo? 
ARTHUR 
Unconstructed dream space. 
ARIADNE 
What's down there? 
ARTHUR 
Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing 
there but what was left behind by 
anyone on the team who's been trapped 
there before. On this team... just 
Cobb. 
ARIADNE 
How long would we be stuck there? 79. YUSUF 
You couldn't even think about 
trying to escape until the sedation

EAMES 
How long? 
YUSUF 
Decadesyit could be infiniteyI 
don't know! Ask himyhe's the one 
who's been there before! 
Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye. 
EAMES 
Great. So now we're stuck in 
Fischer's mind battling it out with 
his private army, and if we get hit 
we're stuck in Limbo 'til our 
brains dissolve into scrambled egg? 
Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly. 
ARTHUR 
Let's just get him upstairs. 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE y MOMENTS LATER 
Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines h im. He 
motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb. 
ARTHUR 
Hold this. Firm pressure. 
Arthur turns to Cobb. 
ARTHUR 
You knew the risks and you didn't 
tell us. 
COBB 
There wasn't meant to be any risk. 
We weren't supposed to be dealing 
with a load of gunnre. 
ARTHUR 
You had no right. 
COBB 
It's the only way you can go three 
layers deep, Arthur. 
Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile. 80. ARTHUR 
And you. You went along with this? 
YUSUF 
I trusted him. 
ARTHUR 
You trusted him? When? When he 
promised you half his share? 
YUSUF 
(offended) 
No! His whole share. Plus, he told 
me he'd done it before. 
Arthur turns to Cobb. 
ARTHUR 
Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out 
great, didn't it, Cobb? 
Cobb grabs Arthur. 
COBB 
You don't know anything about that. 
This was the only way to do this 
job, Arthur. I did what I had to do 
to get back to my children. 
EAMES 
So you led us into a war zone with 
no way out. 
COBB 
We have a way out. The kick. We 
just have to push on, do the job as 
fast as possible and get out using 
the kick. 
EAMES 
Forget it. We go any deeper, we 
just raise the stakes. I'm sitting 
it out on this level. 
COBB 
You'll never make it, Eames. 
Fischer's security is surrounding 
this place as we speak. The ten 
hours of the flight is a week at 
this level−you'll never make it 
without getting killed. Downwards 
is the only way forwards. We have 
to carry on. 
Saito groans. Cobb looks at himy 81. COBB 
And we have to do it fast. 
Eames and Arthur weigh this. 
COBB 
Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's 
get in there and soften him up. 
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE y LATER 
Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from 
Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator. 
FISCHER

No, it won't. 
Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved. 
ARTHUR 
In. your lather's office, below the 
bookshelves, is his personal safe. 
We need the combination. 
FISCHER 
I never noticed a safey 
COBB 
Doesn't mean you don't know the

FISCHER 
Well, I don't. 
ARTHUR 
We have it on good authority that 
you do. 
FISCHER 
Whose? 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE y CONTINUOUS 
Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is open ing a 
HINGED, THREEyWING MIRROR. 
YUSUF 
Five hundred dollars, this cost? 
EAMES 
What's inside? 82. YUSUF 
Cash, cards, ID... and thisy 
Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice F ischer's 
office− YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, h is FATHER 
blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it.  Cobb 
enters. Eames hands him the snapshot. 
EAMES 
Useful? 
Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself i n the 
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad 
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets th e photo. 
COBB 
You're on. You've got an hour. 
EAMES 
An hour? I was supposed to have all 
night to crack him. 
COBB 
And Saito was supposed to keep his 
guts on the inside. You've got an 
houryget something we can use. 
Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances  at his 
watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercyy 
INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE y CONTINUOUS 
Browning's CRY reverberatesy Fischer looks up, conc ernedy 
FISCHER 
What's that? 
ARTHUR 
Good authority. 
Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice . 
FISCHER 
Uncle Peter?! Make them stopy 
ARTHUR 
The combination. 
FISCHER 
I don't know it! 
ARTHUR 
Why would Browning tell us you did? 
FISCHER 
Let me talk to himyI'll find out. 83. INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE y MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, i nto the 
room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb hand cuffs 
Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink. 
COBB 
You've got an hour. Get talking. 
Cobb leaves. 
BROWNING (EAMES) 
They've had me for two days. 
They've got someone with access to 
your father's office and they're 
trying to open his safeythey 
thought I'd know the combination, 
but I don'ty 
FISCHER 
Neither do I, Uncle Peter. 
BROWNING 
(confused) 
Maurice told me that after he 
passed only you would be able to 
open it. 
FISCHER 
He never gave me the combination. 
Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something. 
BROWNING 
He did, he just didn't tell you 
that it was a combination. 
FISCHER 
What, then? 
BROWNING 
Something only you would know. Some 
meaningful combination of numbers 
from your experiences with Mauricey 
FISCHER 
We didn't have  a lot of meaningful 
experiences together. 
BROWNING 
Perhaps after your mother died... 
FISCHER 
After my mother died, I went to him 
in my grief. 84. 
(MORE) You know what he told me? "There's 
really nothing to be said, Robert." 
BROWNING 
He always had a hard time with 
emotionaly 
FISCHER 
I was eleven , Uncle Peter. 
Browning (Eames) takes this in. 
BROWNING 
He loved you, Robert. In his way. 
FISCHER 
"In his way?" At the end he called 
me to his deathbed. He could barely 
speak, but he took the trouble to 
say one last thing to me. He pulled 
me close... I could make out only 
one word. "Disappointed." 
Browning can say nothing. 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE y CONTINUOUS 
Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is 
breathing fast, shallow. 
COBB 
How's he doing? 
ARIADNE 
He's in a lot of pain. 
Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye. 
COBB 
When we get you down to the next 
level, the pain will be less 
intense. 
Saito nods, breathing hard. 
ARIADNE 
(low) 
And if he dies? 
COBB 
His conscious mind will drop out of 
the dream. He'll be trapped in 
Limbo for a lifetime ... 
ARIADNE 
What will that do to him? 85. 
FISCHER (CONT'D) Cobb looks at her. Grave. 
COBB 
When he wakes... his mind could be 
completely gone. 
SAITO 
When... when we wake I will still 
honor our arrangement... 
Cobb looks down at Saito sadly. 
COBB 
Saitoysan, when you wake you might 
not even remember that we had  an 
arrangement. You'll have forgotten 
this world. Limbo will be your 
reality. Lost there so long, you'll 
have become an old man... 
SAITO 
Filled with regret? 
COBB 
Waiting to die alone. Yes. 
SAITO 
Then I'll take the chance and come 
back. And we'll be young men 
together again. 
Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ari adne. 
ARIADNE 
When were you trapped in Limbo? 
Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Sait o. 
ARIADNE 
Cobb, you might have convinced the 
rest of this team to carry on with 
the job. But they don't know the 
truth. 
COBB 
What truth? 
ARIADNE 
The truth that at any minute you 
might bring a freight train  through 
the wall. The truth that Mal is 
bursting up through your 
subconscious. 86. 
(MORE) The truth that as we go deeper into 
Fischer, we're also going deeper 
into youyand I'm not sure we're 
going to like what we find there. 
Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing. 
ARIADNE 
This is not just about Fischer, 
it's about you. Tell me what 
happened to you and Mal. Trapped in 
Limbo. 
Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through. 
COBB 
We were on a job. Exploring dreams 
within dreams. But we didn't 
understand how your mind can turn 
hours into years. How you can get 
trapped. Trapped so deep that when 
you wash up on the shore of your 
subconscious...

Fifty years. 
Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.

Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.. . 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE y CONTINUOUS 
ARIADNE 
And when you finally woke up? 
COBB 
To wake from that. From decades 
lived. To be old souls thrown back 
into youth. It was hard. At first 
Mal seemed okay. But I started to 
realize something was wrong. 
Finally she admitted it. This idea 
she was possessed by. This simple 
little idea that changed 
everything... 
ARIADNE 
What was it? 
COBB 
That our world was not real. No 
matter what I did, no matter what I 
said, she was convinced that we 
were still in a dream. That we 
needed to wake up again...

If it's my dream then why can't I 
control it? Why can't I stop this? 
MAL

You don't know you're dreaming.

CURTAIN BILLOWS. 
EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM y CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK) 
Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of  the

dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles. 
MAL 
Join me. 
COBB 
Mal, come back inside. 
MAL 
No. I'm going to jump. And you're 
coming with me. 
COBB 
No, I'm not. This is real yif you 
jump, you're not going to wake up, 
you're going to die . Let's go back 
inside and talk about this, please. 
MAL 
We've talked enough. 
She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP. 
MAL 
Come out onto the ledge or I'll 
jump right now. 
She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge 
opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop. 
MAL 
I'm asking you to take a leap of 
faith. 
COBB 
I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave 
our children. 
MAL 
If I go without you, they'll take 
them away, anyway. 
COBB 
What do you mean? 90. MAL 
I filed a letter with our attorney. 
Explaining how I'm fearful for my 
safety, how you've threatened to 
kill me... 
Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKI NG... 
MAL (CONT’D) 
I love you, Dom. I’ve freed you 
from the guilt of choosing to leave 
them. We’re going home to our real

Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to rea ch her...

tries to bury his face in the wall...

Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of p aper. 
COBB (V.O.) 
She’d had herself declared sane by 
three different psychiatrists. 
Cobb hears a SHOUTy turns to the garden. James CROU CHES, 
Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNS EEN... 
COBB (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
It was impossible for me to explain 
the nature of her madness... 
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb’s hand. 
THIN MAN 
Right now. Or never, Cobb. 
Cobb turns back to the windowy about to call outy J ames and 
Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks  at the 
paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET. 
COBB (V.O.) 
So I ran. And I’ve been running 
ever since, trying to buy my way 
back to my family... 
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE y DAY 
Cobb looks across at Ariadne. 
ARIADNE 
Psychiatrists judged her sane? 
COBB 
She was  sane. She was just lost in 
the labyrinth. 
ARIADNE 
Then why should you blame yourself? 
COBB 
Because we were a family. And we 
had a life I would do anything to 
get back to now. But that reality 
wasn’t enough for me then. 92. ARIADNE 
It might have been your idea to 
push the limits, Cobb. But you’re 
not responsible for the idea that 
destroyed her. The idea that her 
world wasn’t real... that was her 
own idea from her own mind. 
Cobb says nothing. 
ARIADNE (CONT’D) 
Your guilt defines her. Powers her. 
If we’re going to succeed in this, 
you’re going to have to forgive 
yourself, and you’re going to have 
to confront her. But you don’t have 
to do it alone. 
COBB 
You don’t have to do this for mey 
ARIADNE 
I’m doing it for the others. They 
don’t know the risk they’ve taken 
coming in here with you. 
Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER t ake up a

usy 
BROWNING 
I heard themythey’re going to lock 
us in and run the can into the 
river. 
FISCHER 
What is  in the safe? 93. BROWNING 
Something for you. Maurice always 
said it was his most previous 
gift... a will .
FISCHER 
Maurice’s will is with Port and 
Dunn. 
BROWNING 
It’s an alternate. It supersedes 
the other only if you  want it to. 
FISCHER 
What does it say? 
BROWNING 
It splits all the component 
businesses of Fischer Morrow into 
individual companies, transferring 
ownership to the boards of those 
companies... 
FISCHER 
Leaving me nothing? 
BROWNING 
A basic living. Nothing more. The 
entire empire would cease to exist. 
FISCHER 
Destroy my own inheritance? Why 
would he suggest such a thing? 
BROWNING 
I don’t know, Robert. 
Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him. 
COBB 
Come to your senses? 
FISCHER 
Let us go. I don’t know the 
combination. Not consciously. 
Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his  gun. 
COBB 
Let’s try instinctively. I have 
someone standing in your father’s 
office ready to tap in a 
combination. 
He holds the phone to Fischer’s mouth. 94. COBB (CONT’D) 
First six numbers that come into 
your head. Right now. 
FISCHER

Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browningy

Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.

Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.

powerful the catharsis. 
Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.

work. 
EAMES 
We need the imagery, the words... 
ARIADNE 
So you destroy his one positive 
relationship? 
COBB 
No. We repair his relationship with 
his father and expose his 
godfather’s true nature. 
EAMES 
Hell, we should be charging Fischer 
as much as Saito. 96. ARTHUR 
What about his security? It’s going 
to get worse as we go deeper. 
COBB 
We bring in Mr. Charles.

Fischer in that hotel, they’re

Charles like on the Stein job. 
EAMES 
So you’ve done it before? 
ARTHUR 
Sure. But it didn’t work. The

and his subconscious tore us to 
pieces. 
Eames takes this in. 
EAMES 
You learned a lot, though. Right?

Arthur watches the Subysecurity follow the Blonde. 
ARIADNE

Because it involves telling the

FISCHER (CONT’D) 
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?! 
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing. 
COBB 
Look at the gun in his hand. 
Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol.  Cobb 
opens the First Man’s jacket to show Fischer his ho lster and 
sidearm. 
COBB (CONT’D) 
These men were sent to abduct you. 
Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer. 
COBB (CONT’D) 
If I’m going to help you, I need 
you to be calm. 
Fischer remembers something. 
FISCHER 
If this is a dream, I have to kill 
myself and wake upy 
Fischer raises the gun towards his heady 
COBB 
I wouldn’t do thatythey’ve probably 
got you sedated. If you pull that

Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter .

Christywe’ve been kidnapped. 
COBB 
Where were they holding you? 
FISCHER 
They had us... in the back of a 
van... 
COBB 
Your body’s bouncing around in the 
back of a van right nowythat 
explains the gravity shifts. 
FISCHER 
It was... to do with a safe... 
Christ, why’s it so hard to 
remember? 106. 
COBB (CONT'D) COBB 
It’s like trying to remember a 
dream after you’ve woken up. It 
takes years of practice to do it 
easily. So, you and Browning have 
been pulled into this dream so they 
can steal something from your mind. 
What? 
FISCHER 
They wanted a combination to a 
safe... they demanded the first 
numbers to pop into my head. 
COBB 
That’s them extracting a locator. 
FISCHER 
A locator? 
COBB 
A number from your own 
subconscious. It can be used any 
number of ways... 
(thinking) 
This is a hotel. Room numbers . What 
was the number you gave them? 
FISCHER 
5, 2... something... it was a long

ARIADNE 
Do you use a timer? 
ARTHUR 
No, I have to judge it myself. Once 
you’re all asleep up in room 528, I 
wait ‘til Yusuf starts his kick... 
ARIADNE 
How will you know? 107. ARTHUR 
His music warns me it’s coming, 
then the van hitting the barrier of 
the bridge should be unmistakabley 
that’s when I blow the floor out 
from underneath us and we get a 
nice synchronized kick. Too soon, 
and we won’t get pulled out; too 
late and I won’t be able to drop 
us. 
ARIADNE 
Why not? 
ARTHUR 
The van will be in free fall. I 
can’t drop us with no gravity. 
Arthur finishes setting the charges. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY y CONTINUOUS 
Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming i n the

BROWNING

Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito’s ey e. 
SAITO 
I’m... I mistook you for a friend. 
BROWNING 
Goodylooking fellow, I’m sure. 
Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames. 
EAMES 
That’s Fischer’s projection of 
Browning. We’ll keep an eye on how 
he behavesy 
SAITO 
Why? 
EAMES 
How he acts will tell us if 
Fischer’s starting to suspect his 
motives the way we want him to. 108. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR y MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Aria dne are

Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer. 
COBB 
You know what this is? 
Fischer’s eyes roam over the dials and plungers. 
FISCHER 
I think so. But I don’t understand. 
COBB 
They were going to put you under. 
FISCHER 
I’m already under. 
COBB 
Under again .
FISCHER 
A dream within a dream? 
ARTHUR 
Shhhh! 
Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes  into the 
locky the door starts to openy Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS 
the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOORy puts  his gun 
in their face. IT IS BROWNING. 
Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.
FISCHER 
Uncle Peter. What’s going on? 
Cobb pulls the key from Browning’s hand: ROOM 528. 109. COBB 
You said you were kidnapped 
together? 
FISCHER 
Not exactly, they already had him. 
They’d been torturing him... 
COBB 
You saw  them torture him? 
Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinkin g. 
FISCHER 
The kidnappers are working for you. 
BROWNING 
No, Roberty 
FISCHER 
You’re trying to get that safe 
open. To get the alternate will. 
Browning looks up at Fischer. 
BROWNING 
Fischer Morrow’s been my entire 
life. I can’t let you destroy it. 
FISCHER 
I’m not going to throw away my 
inheritance. Why would I? 
BROWNING 
I couldn’t take the chance of you 
rising to your father’s final 
taunt. 
FISCHER 
What taunt? 
BROWNING 
That will. I’m sorry, Robert, but 
it’s his final insult. A challenge 
to build something for yourself. 
He’s telling you that you aren’t 
worthy of his achievements. 
Fischer takes this in. Devastated. 
FISCHER 
That he was “disappointed?” 110. BROWNING 
I’m so sorry. But he was wrong. 
You’ll make his company even 
greater than he ever could. 
COBB 
Your godfather’s lying, Robert. 
Fischer turns to Cobb. 
FISCHER 
How do you know? 
COBB 
It’s what I do. He’s hiding 
something. 
Cobb looks at Browning. 
COBB 
Let’s find out what. 
Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mecha nism. 
Browning watches. Silent. 
COBB 
Let’s do to him what he was going 
to do to you. 
Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the  same. 
COBB 
We’ll penetrate his subconscious 
and find out what he doesn’t want 
you to know. 
Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decidesy rolls up hi s sleeve, 
offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each o thery 
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps. 
ARTHUR 
He’s out. 
ARIADNE 
Wait, CobbyI’m lost. Whose 
subconscious are we going into? 
COBB 
Fischer’s. I told him it was 
Browning’s so he’d come with us as 
part of our team. 
ARTHUR 
(impressed) 
He’s going to help us break into 
his own subconscious. 111. COBB 
That’s the idea. He’ll think that 
his security is Browning’s and 
fight them to learn the truth about 
his father. 
Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes  out one 
by one. Cobb is last. 
COBB 
Fischer’s subconscious is going to 
run you down hard. 
ARTHUR 
I’ll lead them on a merry chase. 
COBB 
Be back in time for the kick. 
ARTHUR 
I’m on it.

objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a m ile below. 
ARIADNE 
What’s down there? 
COBB 
Hopefully, the truth we want 
Fischer to learn. 
ARIADNE 
I meant what’s down there for you? 
Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive,  SKIING 
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of F ischer’s 
earshot. 
COBB 
You’re the dreamer. I need you to 
draw the security away from the 
complex. 112. EAMES 
Then who guides Fischer in? You? 
COBB 
If I know the route... we could be 
compromised. 
Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over. 
ARIADNE 
I designed the place. 
COBB 
No. You’re with me. 
SAITO (O.S.) 
I could do it. 
They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames sm iles. 
COBB 
Eames, brief Saito on the route 
into the complex. What we’re 
looking for is going to be in the 
most heavily fortified section. 
That north tower. 
Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames s ees BLOOD 
on the snow. Looks at Saito. 
COBB 
Mr. Fischer, you’re going in with 
Mr. Saito. 
FISCHER 
You’re not coming in? 
COBB 
You have to do this on your own. 
You have to get in there, break 
into your godfather’s mind and find 
out the truth about your father. 
Cobb taps Fischer’s radio mike. 
COBB 
Keep this live at all times. I’ll 
be listening in, covering you. 
(holds up the sniper 
rifle) 
The windows on the upper floors are 
big enough that I can cover you

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed . They 
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildin gs. The 
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further i n, the 
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the 
extraordinary collection of buildings− every archit ectural 
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS. 
ARIADNE 
You built all this? 
COBB 
We both did. 128. ARIADNE 
It's incredible. 
COBB 
We built for years. Then, when that 
got stale, we started in on the 
memories. 
A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons , 
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE  BLONDE 
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the 
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run o ff. 
Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE line d with an 
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to  HOUSES. 
COBB 
This is our neighborhood. 
ARIADNE

From what city? 
COBB 
No. Our  neighborhood.

That was our first apartment... 
then we moved to that building... 
we got that small house when Mal 
became pregnant. 
ARIADNE 
You reconstructed them all from

We had time. 
Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Sta ring.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors

Highly contagious, and an idea can

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at  the

Limbo stretching off behind it. 130. MAL 
The smallest idea, such as... "Your

COBB 
I know what's real. 
MAL 
What are  the distinguishing 
characteristics of a dream? Mutable 
laws of physics? Tell that to the 
quantum physicists. Reappearance of 
the dead? What about heaven and 
hell? Persecution of the dreamer, 
the creator, the messiah? They 
crucified Christ, didn't they? 
COBB 
I know what's real. 
MAL 
No creeping doubts? Not feeling 
persecuted, Dom? Chased around the 
globe by anonymous corporations and 
police forces? The way the 
projections persecute the dreamer? 131. Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying. 
MAL 
Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in 
one reality anymore. So choose. 
Choose your reality like I did. 
Choose to be here. Choose me.

Guilt. I feel guilt. And however 
confused I might get. 133.

always there. Telling me something. 
Reminding me of the truth. 
MAL 
What truth? 
COBB 
That you were wrong to doubt our 
world. That the idea that drove you 
to question your reality was a 
lie... 
MAL 
How could you know  it was a lie? 
COBB 
Because it was my lie. 
MAL

Because you planted the idea in my

Because I performed inception on my 
own wife, then reaped the bitter 
rewards... 
ARIADNE 
Why?

SAITO 
You came to convince me to honor

COBB 
Yes. And to take a leap of faith. 
As Saitoysan listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN o n the

greetings with Eames and Yusuf. 
Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fi scher, who

Professor Miles, waving at him...
