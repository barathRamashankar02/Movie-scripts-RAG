But I haven't gotten any messages.
From any of my friends.  Not one.All summer.
DUDLEY
Who'd 
want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON
I should think you'd be moregrateful.  We raise you since youwere a baby, give you food off ourtable, even let you have Dudley'ssecond bedroom... purely out ofthe goodness of our hearts.
DUDLEY
I thought he got the secondbedroom because Mum was afraidhe'd turn us into dung beetles ifyou put him back in the cupboard
under the stairs.
AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle
Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for thepudding.
AUNT PETUNIA
Not yet, popkin.  That's for whenthe Masons arrive.
UNCLE VERNON
Which should be any moment.  Now.Let's run through our schedule onemore time.  Petunia, when theMasons get here, you will be --
AUNT PETUNIA
In the lounge, waiting to welcomethem graciously to our home.

DOBBY
Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands.It's just that, Dobby has come totell you... it is difficult, sir...
Dobby wonders where to begin.
HARRY
Why don't you sit down?
DOBBY
S-s-sit down?
Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS.  LOUD TEARS.  Harry
panics.
HARRY
Shhhh!  I'm sorry.  I didn't meanto offend you or anything --
DOBBY
Offend Dobby!  Dobby has heard ofyour greatness, sir, but never hashe been asked to sit down by awizard, like an equal...
HARRY

Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off thebed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.
DOBBY
Bad Dobby!  Bad Dobby!

Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning
dizzily.  Harry regards him with a mixture of concern...and wariness.
HARRY
Are you... all right?
DOBBY
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.Dobby almost spoke ill of hisfamily, sir.
HARRY
Your... 
family?
DOBBY
The wizard family Dobby serves,sir.  Dobby is bound to serve onefamily forever.  If they ever knewDobby was here...
Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.
DOBBY
But Dobby had to come.  Dobby hasto protect Harry Potter.  To warnhim.
(in a fierce whisper)
Harry Potter must not go back to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry this year.
HARRY
Not go back?  But... I have to.

HARRY
Well, I expect they've been --hang on, how do

Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.
DOBBY
Harry Potter mustn't be angry withDobby -- Dobby hoped if HarryPotter thought his friends hadforgotten him... Harry Pottermight not want to go back toschool, sir...
HARRY
Give me those.  Now.
Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door.Panicking...
11INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS/KITCHEN - DAY 11
... Harry flies desperately after, Dobby bouncing like a
ping-pong ball down the stairs and into the kitchen.  AsHarry races in, he finds Dobby on the counter, waving hisarms.  Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding RISES,then floats into the living room, HOVERING over theMason's heads. The Masons don't see, but the Dursleys --goggle-eyed--do.

I can't.  Hogwarts is my home.

The Masons RACE out of the house, the Dursleys FOLLOWING.
AUNT PETUNIA

The Masons get into their car and drive off, just as a
SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky.  An OWL SWOOPS down, andDROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's feet.  He picks up theletter, opens it.  As he reads it, a mad gleam dances inUncle Vernon's eye.  He turns and races back inside thehouse.  Aunt Petunia follows.

A SHORT MONTAGE BEGINS:
Uncle Vernon fits IRON BARS to the inside of Harry's

Drills a METAL FLAP to the base of the bedroom door.Fits a FAT, GREY LOCK to the door itself.  Soaking with
sweat, he casts Harry a nasty grin and pulls shut theDOOR.  It closes with the DULL CLANK of a cell.
13INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13
Harry stares gloomily out the window.  The METAL FLAP
RATTLES and Dudley's pudgy hand slides a BOWL of TINNEDSOUP onto the floor.  He grins cruelly through theopening.
DUDLEY

HARRY
Well done, Dudley.  Finallylearned the days of the week, haveyou.
DUDLEY

UNCLE VERNON

As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGESFORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle.  Harry tumbles into the
darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other
reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possiblesecond.
Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls

A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLEthemselves, providing a cooling breeze for Ron's agingrat, SCABBERS.  Ron shrugs, averts his eyes self-consciously.

Ladies and gentlemen!  What anextraordinary moment this is!When young Harry here stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning

Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shakeHarry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over thefringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLTSCAR.  At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Forgive me, Mr. Potter.  But yourscar is legend.  As, of course, isthe wizard who gave it to you.
HARRY
He was a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Yes, a pity about your parents.Curious that you yourself shouldescape with a mere flesh wound.Curious, too, that you speak ofhim in the past.  Surely, youdon't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is gone forever.

His name is Voldemort.
Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.

You must be very brave, Mr.Potter, to dare speak his name.Or foolish.

It means dirty blood.  Mudblood'sa really foul name for someone whowas Muggle-born.  Someone withnon-magic parents.  Someone...like me.  It's not a term oneusually hears in civilizedconversation.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Salazar Slytherin wished to bemore selective about the studentsadmitted to Hogwarts.  He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families.In other words, purebloods.Unable to sway the others, hedecided to leave the school.
(a beat)
According to legend, Slytherin hadbuilt a hidden chamber in thiscastle, known as the Chamber ofSecrets.  Shortly beforedeparting, he sealed it until thattime when his own true heirreturned to the school.  The heiralone would be able to open theChamber of Secrets and unleash thehorror within, and by so doing,purge the school of all those who,in Slytherin's view, were unworthyto study magic.
HERMIONE
Muggle-borns.

Yes.  Naturally, the school has beensearched many times for such a
chamber.  It has never been found.

legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?

Harry, Ron, Hermione and good number of other studentswatch.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
Gather round!  Gather round!  Caneveryone see me? Can you all hearme?  Excellent.  In light of thedark events of recent weeks,Professor Dumbledore has grantedme permission to start this littleDueling Club, to train you all upin case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done
on countless occasions -- for fulldetails, see my published works.
The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns tohim.
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY
That Lockhart's something, isn'the?  Awfully brave chap.
(offering his hand)
Justin Finch-Fletchley.Hufflepuff.
HARRY
Nice to meet you.  I'm --
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY
I know who you are.  We all do.Even us Muggle-borns.
Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, whereProfessor Snape has joined Lockhart.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
Let me introduce my assistant
Professor Snape.  He has
sportingly agreed to help me witha short demonstration.  Now Idon't want any of you youngstersto worry.  You'll still have yourPotions Master when I'm throughwith him, never fear!
RON
What's the fun in that?
Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow.  They turn,walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords.

I wouldn't bet on that.
GILDEROY LOCKHART

A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTSLockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.
HERMIONE
Do you think he's all right?
HARRY/RON
Who cares?
GILDEROY LOCKHART
(rising unsteadily)
Well, there you have it.  That wasa Disarming Charm.  As you see,I've lost my wand.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
(as Hermione returns it)
Ah, thank you, Miss Granger.  Yes,an excellent idea to show themthat, Professor Snape, but if youdon't mind my saying so, it wasvery obvious what you were aboutto do.  If I had wanted to stopyou it would have been only tooeasy...
SNAPE
Perhaps it would be prudent tofirst teach the students to 
block
unfriendly spells, Professor.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

SNAPE
Weasley's wand causes devastationwith the simplest spells.  We'llbe sending Potter to the hospitalwing in a matchbox.  Might Isuggest someone from my own house.Malfoy, perhaps.
Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they taketheir places onstage.  Grudgingly, they bow to eachother.
DRACO
Scared, Potter?
HARRY
You wish.
They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.
GILDEROY LOCKHART
Wands at the ready!  When I countto three, cast your charms todisarm your opponent -- 
only to
disarm.  We don't want anyaccidents.  One, two --
Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with aBLAST of WHITE LIGHT.  He jumps up, points his wand.
HARRY

A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach.He doubles up, WHEEZING.
GILDEROY LOCKHART

Lockhart flicks his wand.   BANG!  The SNAKE flies intothe air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towardsJustin Finch-Fletchley.  As students SCREAM, Harry --oddly calm -- approaches the snake.  It rises, fangsexposed, poised to strike Justin.
HARRY
(in Parseltongue)
Leave him!
The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.
HARRY
(in Parseltongue)
LEAVE HIM!
The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously --slumps to the floor.  Harry blinks, as if coming out of atrance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his handto Justin.
JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY
What are you playing at?
Terrified, Justin backs away.  Confused, Harry eyes thefaces around him.  Malfoy looks shocked.  Seamus andNeville's eyes glitter with fear.  Ginny bolts the room.Snape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF OFBLACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is bothshrewd and calculating.

Come on.  Move.

I didn't realize -- how can Ispeak a language without knowing Ican?
HERMIONE
I don't know, Harry.  But itsounded like you were egging thesnake on or something.  It was...creepy.
As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harrywarily.  Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk bywithout a word.

72EXT. HOGWARTS' LANDSCAPE - DAY 72
A heavy snow falls.  Harry sits atop one of the towering
hills facing Hogwarts.  Hedwig sits beside him.
HARRY
Who am I, Hedwig?  What am I?
73INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 73
The trio study.  Harry, burdened by dark thoughts, looks
up at Ron.
He smiles at Harry, then, seconds later, Hermione does
the same -- something forced about it all.  Unable tobear it, Harry gathers his books, gets up from the table.
As Harry walks, students glance up, meet his gaze, then
look away.  Even MADAM PINCE eyes him from her desk.Ginny Weasley, tired and pale, scribbles furiously in aSMALL BLACK BOOK.
Harry exits, walks into the hallway and pauses.  From
inside a room, the VOICES of a group of Hufflepuffs can
be heard.
ERNIE
So, anyway, I told Justin to hide
up in our dormitory.  I mean tosay, if Potter's marked him downas his next victim, it's best hekeep a low profile for a while.

Justin let it slip to Potter that
he was Muggle-born.
HANNAH
And you definitely think Potter'sthe Heir of Slytherin?
ERNIE
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.Everyone knows that's the mark ofa dark wizard.  Have you everheard of a decent one who couldtalk to snakes?  They called
Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.
(whispering darkly)
Remember what was written on the
wall:  
Enemies of the Heir Beware.
Potter had some sort of run-inwith Filch.  Next thing we know,Filch's cat's attacked.  Thatfirst-year Creevey's been annoyingPotter.  Then Creevey's attacked.
HANNAH
He always seems so nice, though.And, after all, he is the one whomade You Know Who disappear.
ERNIE
That's probably why You Know Who
wanted to kill him in the firstplace.  Didn't want another DarkLord competing with him.
Harry doesn't need to hear anymore.  He slips quietlyaway.

Harry enters, slows.  Up ahead, in the light of a
FLICKERING TORCH, something DARK lies.  A WINDOWPANERATTLES in the WIND and the torch... goes out.  Harrysteps closer, finds...
Justin-Finch-Fletchley.  Lying rigid on the floor, a look
of shock on his frozen face.  Nearby, an inert NearlyHeadless Nick floats, body teeming with BLACK SMOKE.Kneeling, Harry notices a TRAIL OF SPIDERS scuttling awayfrom Justin's body and out the loose windowpane... whensuddenly...

Harry steps out of the Gargoyle's embrace and enters a
large, circular room.  STRANGE SILVER INSTRUMENTS WHIRquietly.  On a nearby shelf, the SORTING HAT sits.  Harrycasts a wary eye at the PAST HEADMASTERS snoozing in thePORTRAITS around him.  In the last portrait, theHeadmaster is awake, reading a book.  He is PROFESSORDIPPET.  Harry approaches the Sorting Hat, glancesaround, then places it atop his head.

Harry strips the hat off, tosses it back onto the shelf.
HARRY
You're wrong!
The hat sits motionless.  Silent.  Hearing a GAGGINGSOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES)sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH.  It wobbles, then... BURSTSINTO FLAMES.  As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror-struck.
HARRY
Professor, your bird... I couldn'tdo anything... He just caughtfire.

Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts,when it happened.  What if hewrote about what he saw?  It'spossible he knew where the Chamberwas, how to open it, even whatsort of creature lives in it.  Ifso, whoever's behind the attacksthis time wouldn't want a diarylike this lying around, wouldthey?
HARRY
That's a brilliant theory,Hermione.  With just one tinylittle flaw.  There's nothingwritten in this diary.

Harry starts to set the diary aside, then notices a
BOTTLE OF INK sitting on the desk.  An idea flickers.Taking his QUILL, Harry dips it, and hesitates.  As hedoes, a DROP of INK hangs, suspended like a tear, then...DROPS.
The ink BLAZES briefly, then... VANISHES... as if it were
sucked into the page.  Excited, Harry dips his quill
again, and, this time, writes:  
My name is Harry Potter.
The words blaze, VANISH.  Slowly, oozing out of the page,
comes a response:  Hello, Harry Potter.  My name is Tom

Harry's mind races.  Deciding, he MUTTERS the words hewrites:

As Harry advances, LOW VOICES emanate from the shadows.
As he reaches the boy, Harry speaks in a WHISPER:
HARRY
Excuse me.  Could you tell mewhere I am?  Hello...?
The boy doesn't respond, eyes staked to the activity in

I never saw any part of the castlebut the cupboard in which Hagridkept me.  The girl was discoveredin a bathroom.  When I wasaccused, Hagrid brought me here.
More SCRABBLING.  Ron looks up.  We PAN UP with him.SEE:  SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPINGDOWNWARD like paratroopers.  Ron GRABS Harry.
HARRY

What!
Ron points.  Harry looks.  Pales.  Turns slowly back toAragog.
HARRY
Well... thank you.  We'll justgo...
ARAGOG
Go?  I think not.  My sons anddaughters do not harm Hagrid, onmy command.  But I cannot denythem fresh meat when it wanders sowillingly into our midst.Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.
RON
Can we panic now?
CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!  Harry and Ron SPIN.  A GANG ofFIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead.  Begin to move
forward.  Harry and Ron SPIN again:  SPIDERS.
Everywhere.  CLOSING IN.
Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand.  The
spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC ofthe LIGHT chases itself away.  Around and around.  Then:
The LANTERN goes out.Harry pitches it aside.  As one, he and Ron draw their

Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window.Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE.

'Of the many fearsome beasts that
roam our land, none is more deadly

living for hundreds of years,
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.  Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it.'

Ron!  This is it!  The monster inthe Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk .  That's why I can hear
it speak.  It's a snake.
RON
But it kills by looking people inthe eye.  Why is it no one's dead?
Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he andRon's REFLECTION in the window opposite.  He muttersSOFTLY:

the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain.  Fawkes wings away,its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS:the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.
TOM RIDDLE
Fool!  Think you're safe!  It canstill 
hear you!
As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKINGBLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE.Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about tostrike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDETUNNEL.

sees the snake eclipse the light at the far end of thetunnel and SLITHER QUICKLY inside.

Thinking, Harry DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE, puts his hand over
his mouth and waits, desperate to remain STILL andSILENT.  The snake slides heavily by, then... SLOWS.TURNS BACK.
The snake's head weaves inside, only INCHES from Harry's
face.  Harry trembles as the snake's head cocks to theside, then... finally... WITHDRAWS.

Harry DASHES back into the main chamber.  Ginny looks
frighteningly pale.  Riddle GRINS cruelly, almost SOLIDnow.

TOM RIDDLE
Yes, Potter.  The process is
nearly complete.  In a fewminutes, Ginny Weasley will bedead.  And I will cease to be amemory.  Lord Voldemort willreturn.  Very much... alive.
Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISKSHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front ofHarry.  Trapped, Harry glances around, then --impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statueof Salazar Slytherin.  The serpent strikes madly, butHarry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
top.  He turns.  Sees the Sorting Hat.  Sees what
glitters within:  the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.
Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
serpent like St. George and the dragon.  In a mad rush ofcourage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWNits back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED.  Too tired to flee,Harry simply waits.  The serpent rises and, FANGSBARED... STRIKES.
Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of theSERPENT'S mouth.  It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY asit drives a FANG into Harry's arm.  Harry clutches hisarm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goesSTILL.
Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
blood soaking slowly into his robe.  As he yanks the fangfree, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now.  Hiseyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.
TOM RIDDLE
Remarkable, isn't it?  How quicklythe venom of the Basilisk
penetrates the body?  If you have
any final words, Potter, you'dbest speak them now.  I'd guessyou have little more than a minuteto live.
Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearmturns a troubling gray.

As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly whitenow, a small ghost, the only evidence of life theTREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER.  Harry studies the fingerand what lies beneath it:  Tom Riddle's diary.  Harrybegins to crawl toward her.

As Harry reaches Ginny, he places his hand on hers,then... slips the diary free.
TOM RIDDLE
What are you doing?  No.  Stop...
Riddle's face creases in fear.  He LUNGES FORWARD.  ButHarry is too quick.  Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES
THE FANG into the book.  Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from
the pages.
TOM RIDDLE
No!
Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain.  His body begins towither instantly, growing BLURRY once more.  As the inkruns off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHESaltogether.  Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAINTMOAN.  Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks.  As shesees Harry, she SOBS.
GINNY
Harry.  It was me!  But I swear, Ididn't mean to... Riddle made me.He wrote to me... took me over...I didn't even know whose diary itwas.  I found it inside mycauldron.  The day we all went to

There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, layshis head onto Harry's arm.
HARRY
You were brilliant, Fawkes.  Ijust... wasn't quick enough.
Then Harry blinks, looks down.  Thick pearly TEARS aretrickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm.  Almostinstantly, his wound... begins to heal itself.

Ron wriggles through, rushes forward and hugs Ginny.
RON
You're alive.  I can't believe it.

Harry eyes Lockhart, sitting by himself, HUMMINGplacidly.
RON

Hello.  Odd sort of place, this,isn't it?  Do you live here?

Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand in
Dumbledore's office.  Fawkes perches on a pedestal behindDumbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charreddiary.  He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.
DUMBLEDORE
Ingenious.  Simply... ingenious.
(looking up)
Of course, Tom Riddle was probablythe most brilliant studentHogwarts has ever seen.  I taughthim myself fifty years ago.  Afterhe left, I would occasionally hearstories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after awhile, even
the rumors stopped.  When hefinally resurfaced as LordVoldemort, most people hadcompletely forgotten the cleverHead Boy he'd once been.

chocolate.  I always find that
cheers me up.  Minerva, will youshow Arthur and Molly up to thehospital wing?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Certainly, Albus.
As they exit, Harry and Ron watch them go.  Mrs.Weasley's VOICE carries:
MRS. WEASLEY
A diary that writes back to you!Honestly, Ginny!  What were youthinking?  Haven't I always toldyou?  Never trust anything thatcan think for itself 
if you can't

Harry and Ron turn back.  See Dumbledore regarding themgravely.
DUMBLEDORE
You two realize, of course, thatin the last few hours, you havebroken perhaps a dozen schoolrules?

First, Harry, I want to thank you.
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber.Nothing but that could have calledFawkes to you.  Secondly, I senseyou're

You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,
because Lord Voldemort can speakParseltongue.  Unless I'm muchmistaken, he transformed some ofhis own powers to you the night hegave you that scar.
HARRY
Voldemort put a bit of himself in
me?
DUMBLEDORE
Not intentionally, but... yes.
HARRY
So the Sorting Hat was right.  I
should be a Slytherin.
DUMBLEDORE
It's true, Harry.  You do possessmany of the qualities Voldemorthimself prizes.  Resourcefulness.Determination.  A certaindisregard for the rules.  Yet theSorting Hat placed you inGryffindor.
HARRY
Only because I 
asked it to.
DUMBLEDORE
Exactly.   Which makes you very
different from Voldemort.  It'snot our abilities that show whatwe truly are, Harry.  It's ourchoices.
(smiling at him)
If you want proof that you belongin Gryffindor, Harry, I suggestyou look more closely at 
this.
Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry.  AnENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt.

Suddenly, Lucius Malfoy enters, dragging... Dobby by the

HARRY
Dobby!  This  is your Master?  The

Dobby nods, chagrined.  Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.
LUCIUS MALFOY
Out of my way, Potter.
(to Dumbledore)
So!  You've returned!
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.  When the governors heardthat Arthur Weasley's daughter hadbeen taken into the Chamber, theysaw fit to summon me back.
(a wry smile)
Curiously, several of them seemed
under the impression that you
would curse their families if theydidn't agree to suspend me in thefirst place, Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY
From the beginning, my onlyconcern has been the welfare ofthis school and its students.I assume the culprit has beenidentified.
DUMBLEDORE
Oh yes.  It was Voldemort.  Onlythis time, he chose to act throughsomeone else.  By means of...
this.
As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy,Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary toLucius.
DUMBLEDORE
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potterdiscovered it.

Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leansclose to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:

He turns away.  As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching thediary in his hand, Harry mouths the words:
