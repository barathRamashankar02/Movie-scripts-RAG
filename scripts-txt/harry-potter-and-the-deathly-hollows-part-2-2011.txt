... the WARNER BR OS. LOGO surfaces...
... then VANISHES... swallowed by the shifting darkness 
once more.  Slowly we  discern th at the darkness  has form, 
surface.  There is  a sense of movem ent as we realize 
we...
EXT. DARK W ATER - NIGHT E162B E162B
... are RUSHING wicked fast over  dark water, hastened by 
a STIFF WIND.  Be low, a SHADOW flicker s intermittently on 
the water’s surface but it is too dark and t he surface 
too uncertain for  the shadow to be identified.
We RISE SLIGHTLY,  the VIEW EX PANDING until a SMALL ISLAND 
comes INTO VIEW.  We CIRCLE S LOWLY.  All is dark below.  
The WIND SCREAMS.  Then something GLIMMERS, something 
PALE and SMOOTH, an OBELISK crafted  of MARBLE.
We DROP FROM t he sky, as if on wings.
EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS ACTI ON - NIGHT E162C E162C
The obelisk looms larger from this vantage p oint.  A tomb 
fit for an emperor.  A NAME is i nscribed upon its 
surface:  ALBU S DUMBLEDORE.
The obelisk begins to TREMBLE, then  DRIFTS S LOWLY ASIDE, 
revealing a TRANSLUCENT  STONE SLAB, be yond which a BODY 
in REPOSE c an be discerned.
SMASH!  The tr anslucent slab SHA TTERS.  The air glimmers 
briefly with diam ond-like shards and Dumbledore ’s body is 
revealed.  He app ears to be sleepin g.  A few of the 
diamond shards cl ing to his cheek.  A SHADOW -- the 
shadow from befor e -- eclipses his face and...
... VOLDEMORT appears, peering down at Dumbledore’s 
lifeless body.  For a moment, he  simply stares, 
transfixed by the sight of his old foe at pe ace.  Then he 
reaches out and...
... covers Dum bledore’s interlaced han ds with his own.  
The moment is odd ly tender.  After a m oment, he retracts 
his hand, clai ming the WAND clutched in Dumbledore’s 
fingers as his own.  He studies it,  his face a mask.  The 
wind rises yet again , carrying us A WAY, BACK TO...

A LAKE COMES I NTO VIEW, the BLACK L AKE of HO GWARTS, its F162 F162
surface thick and st ill as tar, shroud ed in what appears 
to be a FOUL MIST  but which is, we come to find, in 
reality a fest ering cluster of  DEMENTORS...
The Quidditch Pitch stands si lent, untended, faded House G162 G162
flags hangi ng limply...
Under the slate s ky, the CASTLE sta nds like a dark H162 H162
fortress, its qui rky angles and gleaming windows 
diminished in the  gray light...
FIGURES COME INTO  VIEW, STUDENTS, m arching in lines,  I162 I162
like GRIM REGIMEN TS, across the BRIDGE, chivvied on by a 
pair of DEATH EATERS (ALECTO and AMYCUS CARR OW) while 
high upon a ballustr ade, his face a ma sk, SEVERUS SNAPE 
looks on.  We DRAW CLOSER, but nothing more is revealed.  
His face remai ns a mask, his eyes untelling.  Finally, he 
turns away, his CLOAK wiping our field, pitc hing us once 
more into...
EXT. NIGHT SKY  - NIGHT 162 162
DARKNESS.  The ST ATIC, little more tha n a feeble hiss 
now, dies out altoge ther.  A SOFT WHIS PER of WIND fills 
our ears, faint b ut clear, and we a re MOVING once more, 
UP HIGH yet again .  The earth fa lls away below us, 
revealing...
A sea of treet ops, shifting e erily as we SWEEP OVER them.  
A gravel road COMES INTO VIEW, and the n, a few yards on, 
FIGURES on foot. 
EXT. MALFOY MA NOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 163 163
SCABIOR, FENRIR G REYBACK and a ragt ag group of SNATCHERS 
escort HARRY, RON  and HERMIONE past thick yew hedges.  
Hermione eyes a white peacock , looking li ke a ghostly 
lawn ornament.  Harry, his face horribly swollen, 
WHISPERS:
HARRY
What did yo u put on me?
HERMIONE
A Stinging Jinx.
HARRY
How long will it last?2.
CONTINUED:E162C E162C
(CONTINUED)HERMIONE
Not long.
Harry glances down, sees his GLASSES cupped in Hermione’s 
palm.  As he slips them  into his pocke t, the group 
suddenly slows.  Up ahead, on th e other side of the gate, 
BELLATRIX, LUCIUS  and NARCISSA appr oach.  Scabior grabs 
Harry’s arm, push es his face up to the iron bars.  
Bellatrix s teps close.
BELLATRIX
Show me.
Scabior reaches o ut his DIRTY FINGERS and pu shes Harry’s 
hair roughly off his  forehead.  Bellat rix SHINES her 
wand.  Despite th e swelling, one in triguing fea ture can 
be seen:  a SCAR, in the shape of a LIGHTNING BOLT?  
Bellatrix studies it long and ha rd... then SMILES.
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NI GHT (SECONDS LATER) 164 164
As Bellatrix l eads the proces sion inside, she speaks to 
Narcissa.
BELLATRIX
Get Draco.
Narcissa eyes her sister b riefly, warily,  then strides 
off, toward the brightly-lit room ahead, where her 
husband Lucius st ands, cradling a n early-empty wine 
glass.
LUCIUS
Why Draco?
Narcissa passes her husband w ithout a word.
BELLATRIX
Just sit back and watch, Lucius.  
Hm?  Pour yoursel f another glass 
of wine.
As she passes,  she flicks her finger off the  rim of his 
glass -- pling!

Bellatrix turns, eyeing Harry, R on and Hermione.3.

(CONTINUED)BELLATRIX
Where’d you  find them?
SCABIOR
In the N orth Forest.
WORMTAIL quiet ly enters the room.  As Har ry eyes him, 
Bellatrix pauses,  studying his scar again.  
BELLATRIX
Lovely scar f, Scabior.  Though I’m 
not sure it’s  your color.
SCABIOR
It’s not mine.
BELLATRIX
You don’t say.
Her eyes slide, catch him lookin g at Hermione.
BELLATRIX
Fancy her, do you, Scabior?  Can’t 
say I blame you.  Maybe we’ll work 
out a little rewa rd for you, hm?  
That is, assum ing all is as it 
appears.  A h, Draco.  C ome here, 
darling.
From the shadows at the far end of the room Draco 
separates from Na rcissa, steps c autiously forward.
BELLATRIX
My friends here s ay they’ve got 
Harry Potter.  Seeing as he’s an 
old school chum of yours, I 
thought you could confi rm the fact 
for us.
Draco stares at Harry.
BELLATRIX
Well...?
DRACO
I can’t... I c an’t be sure.
Lucius steps f orward, wine gl ass sloshing.
LUCIUS
Look close , Draco.  If we’re the 
ones who hand Pot ter over to the 
Dark Lord, everythin g will be 
forgiven.  Do you  understand --4.

(CONTINUED)SCABIOR
(quietly menacing)
Now, we won’t be forgetting who 
actually caught h im, I hope, Mr. 
Malfoy?
BELLATRIX
Of course not.
(eyes hardening)
Narcissa.  Tend to  your husband.
Lucius staggers b ack nervously next  to his wife.
BELLATRIX
(to Draco)
Don’t be shy, swe etheart.  Get up 
nice and close.
Bellatrix nudg es Draco forward until he’s only inches 
from Harry.
DRACO
What’s wrong w ith his face?
BELLATRIX
What is wrong with his face, 
Scabior?
SCABIOR
He came to us that way.  I reckon 
he picked it up  in the forest.
BELLATRIX
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Bellatrix, eyes f lashing, steps up close to Hermione.
BELLATRIX
Was it you, de arie?  Give me her 
wand.  We’ll s ee what the last 
spell was.
Hermione looks al armed as a Snatcher steps forward.
BELLATRIX
What is that?
Bellatrix’s tone is quietly murdero us.  She pushes past 
Scabior and Gr eyback, steps before another Snatcher.   
Hermione’s beaded pu rse dangles from o ne hand.  In the 
other, he holds... the Sword of Gryffindor.
BELLATRIX
Where did y ou get that!5.

(CONTINUED)SNATCHER
It was in her bag when we searched 
her.  Reckon it ’s mine now.
Bang!  Quick as lightning, Be llatrix stuns the Snatcher 
and catches the s word as he drop s.  Scabior wheels.
SCABIOR
Are you mad!
Bang!  Bellatr ix drops him to his knees b efore his wand 
escapes his cl oak.  He BELLOW S in fury.
SCABIOR
How dare you!  Release me, woman!
Bellatrix star es at him, eyes full of fire, then flicks 
her wand and he slumps forwar d, wincing.
BELLATRIX
Go.  GO!
Scabior eyes her res entfully, then exi ts with Greyback 
and the others.  Bellatrix turns.
BELLATRIX
Wormtail.  Put th ese two in the 
cellar.  I want to  have a little 
conversation with this one.  Girl 
to girl.
As Wormtail jerks them away, Ron’s eyes flash with panic, 
meet Hermione’s.  She mouths:  “It’s okay.”
INT. CELLAR - CONTINUOUS ACTI ON - NIGHT 167 167
Wormtail prods Harry and R on down a steep  flight of 
stairs, SLAMS the do or.  Ron throws himself aga inst it, 
turns to Harry.
RON
Harry!  What’re we  going to do?  
We can’t just leave Hermione alone 
with her!
LUNA
Ron?  Harry...?
Harry peers in to the small, s hadowy space below, senses 
movement.
HARRY

Bellatrix twir ls a SILVER DAGGER in her fingers.
BELLATRIX
This sword is meant to be in my

get it?
HERMIONE
I don’t know what you’re talking 
about.
BELLATRIX
Liar.  What el se did you take?
INT. CELLAR - SAM E TIME - NIGHT 169 169
CLICK! -- Ron, Delum inator in hand,  sends a BAL L of LIGHT 
across the dar kness and a GASLIGHT BLOOMS faintly.  
Luna’s pale face floats forward, hovers vaguely.
LUNA
You look strange,  Harry.  Mr. 
Ollivander, lo ok who’s here.  It’s 
Harry Potter.
Harry looks past Luna and sees a GO BLIN (GRIPHOOK) 
standing in the s hadows.  Next to h im, sitti ng slumped 
against the wa ll, is the wandmak er OLLIVANDER, looking 
frail.  His chin lifts slightly,  runny ey es glimmering 
against the li ght as he studies Harry’s swollen face.
HARRY
Hello, sir.
Ollivander falters, his  face troubled.  Harry eyes him 
curiously, when Bellatrix’s voice ECHOES thr ough the 
VENT.
BELLATRIX (O.S.)
I’m going to ask you once again:  
what else did you and your friends 
take from my vault!
HERMIONE (O.S.)
I told you.  I don’t know what 
you’re talking --
Hermione SCREAMS in pain.  Ron s lams his fist against the 
wall, turns.
RON
We have to do som ething, Harry!7.
(CONTINUED)OLLIVANDER
There’s no way ou t.  We’ve tried 
everything.
LUNA
You’re b leeding, Harry.
She points downwa rd.  Harry r emoves his glas ses from his 
pocket, slips them on and peers at his so ck, where BLOOD 
has soaked through.  Harry reaches down, pul ling the sock 
away from his ank le, revealing a SMALL GASH and th e thing 
that caused it:  the MIRROR SHARD. 
LUNA
That’s a curious thing to hide in 
your sock.
Taking the shard,  Harry turns the silvery si de toward 
himself (and only  himself) -- and f or a split second -- 
the EYE seems to flicker there again.  Harry  wipes away 
the film of blood... but t he eye is gone.
LUNA
You were hiding it, weren’t you?
Before Harry can respond, Hermione SCREAM S again.  Pained 
by this, Harry de bates something, then peers  into the 
mirror:
HARRY
Help us.
The others study him  curiously, then F OOTSTEPS SOUND.  
Ron CLICKS the Deluminator and all goes DARK.  The cellar 
door squeals open  and Wormtail’s si lhouette appears in a 
shaft of light.  Ron rushes forward , but Wormtail stops 
him with a gestur e of his wand.
RON
Let her go!  Let her go!
WORMTAIL
Shut it!  You.  G oblin.  Come with 
me.
As Griphook mount s the stairs he turns, e yeing Harry 
curiously, then W ormtail grabs his arm, slam s shut the 
door.  Ron cli cks the Deluminator a gain and -- CRACK! -- 
as light returns. .. DOBBY materializes  before them.
HARRY
Dobby.  What’re you doing here?8.
CONTINUED:169 169
(CONTINUED)DOBBY
Dobby has come to rescue Harry 
Potter, of course.
Everyone stare s, stunned.  Ha rry stares in similar 
amazement at t he mirror glitteri ng in his palm.
HARRY
Do you mean to  say you can 
Apparate in and out of here?  And 
take us with you?
DOBBY
Of course.  I’m an elf.
RON
Works for me.
HARRY
Right.  Dobby, I want you to take 
Luna and Mr. O llivander to --
RON
Shell Cottage on the  outskirts of 
Tinworth.
(as Harry looks at 
him)
Trust me.
Harry nods, turns to Luna.
HARRY
You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander?
LUNA
Of course.
(to Dobby)
Whenever you’re  ready, sir.
Dobby blinks at Luna’s use of “sir. ”  He GRINS.
DOBBY
Like her very  much.
(to Ron and Harry)
Meet me at the top of the stairs 
in ten seconds.
Luna takes Ollivander’ s withered hand in hers and Dobby 
reaches out.  CRA CK! -- they van ish.  Harry and  Ron peer 
at each other, then rush up t he stairs towar d the SLIVER 
of LIGHT under the door ab ove.  CRACK!  The knob turns 
and light splashes into the c ellar as...
... Wormtail f ills the doorway.9.

stiff as a boa rd, tumbling in  a heavy heap on  the cement 
floor below.  The y turn back as Dob by appears, Wormtail’s 
wand in his tiny fist.
DOBBY
Who gets his wand?
INT. CORRIDOR TO MAI N ROOM - NIG HT (MOMENTS LATER) 170 170
Quickly, cautious ly, Harry and Ron (brandishing 
Wormtail’s wand now)  pad toward the ma in room as Dobby 
slips off in another  direction.  As Ro n steps past the 
lifeless Snatcher without a g lance, Harry hesitates, 
glances down.
Something FLUTTERS W EAKLY in the Snatcher ’s pocket.  The 
tip of a golden w ing.  Harry cro uches, looks.  It’s the 
Snitch.
RON
Sss.
Harry looks up , sees Ron g esturing for him.  Quickly, he 
takes the Snit ch, slips it in his pocket.
NEW ANGLE As Harry joins  Ron and looks:
Slowly, Bellatrix comes INTO VIE W, towering over 
Griphook, who holds the sword , studying i t.  Hermione 
lies at Bellatrix’s feet.  Seeing her,  Ron starts to 
lurch forward.  H arry rest rains him.
BELLATRIX
Well?
GRIPHOOK
I left Gringotts employ many weeks 
ago, but when I w as last in your 
vault, the swo rd was there.
Hermione studi es the two then wa tches as a STRAND of 
BELLATRIX’S HAIR dri fts free and, as if in a dream, 
floats through the air...
BELLATRIX
Perhaps it just walk ed out on its 
own then.10.
CONTINUED: (3)169 169
(CONTINUED)GRIPHOOK
There is no place safer than 
Gringotts, Mad am LeStrange.
... and catches on Hermione’s shirt.
BELLATRIX
Liar!  You can ’t deceive me!
As Hermione looks up, away from the  hair, Bellatrix 
slashes the da gger across Gri phook’s cheek and a deep 
gash opens.  He b arely flinches, the hint of  a SMILE on 
his lips.  Bellat rix looks mildly unnerved by his 
reaction.
BELLATRIX
Consider yourself lucky, Goblin.  The same won’t be said for this 
one.
Bellatrix poises the dagger over Hermione.
RON
Like hell!
Bellatrix whee ls, sees Ron pelting forward.
RON
Expelliarmus!
Bellatrix’s dangling  wand shoots free, tumbles end over 
end... right into  Harry’s hand.
HARRY
Stupefy!
Lucius Malfoy drops instantly, his wine glas s shattering 
in a burgundy bloom on the hearth.  Na rcissa and Draco 
draw their wands.  J ETS of LIGHT spray  across the room.
BELLATRIX
Stop or she dies!
Harry and Ron fre eze, see Hermione lea ning limp ly against 
Bellatrix, the dagger at her throat.
BELLATRIX
Drop your wands.
Ron stands rigidl y, staring baleful ly at Bellatrix.
BELLATRIX
I said drop them!11.
CONTINUED:170 170
(CONTINUED)RON
(angrily)
All right!
Ron flings away W ormtail’s wand.  Harry drops 
Bellatrix’s.
BELLATRIX
Pick them up, Draco.  Now!  Well, 
well, look what we  have here.  
Harry Potter.  Al l bright, shiny 
and new again.  J ust in time for 
the Dark Lord.
Harry glances in the  mirror opposite, sees that the 
Stinging Jinx is wearing off.
BELLATRIX
Call him, Draco.
Draco hesitate s.  But Luci us doesn’t, pullin g up his 
sleeve and touchi ng his finger to the DARK MARK on his 
forearm.  Harry’s SCAR CONSTRICTS and he GRIMACES in 
agony.  Bellatrix CACKLES maniacally, her  knife pressed 
against the tende r flesh of Hermione’ s neck.  A bead of 
blood bubbles on the  blade and then ... a GRINDING NOISE 
is HEARD.  Harry gla nces up, sees the CHANDELIER begin to 
TREMBLE.  As the TINKLE of GLASS fills the room, 
Bellatrix stares directly upward, w atching as...
... the chande lier bursts free of  the ceiling and 
plummets.  Bellat rix bolts and Herm ione stagger s clear, 
falling into Ron’s a rms.  Griphook grabs the  sword and as 
GLASS EXPLODES in razor-sharp sl ivers, Draco screams and 
covers his bloody  face.  Harry w rests the bl ood-soaked 
wands from his ha nds and, wheeli ng, points all three at 
Lucius.
HARRY
Stupefy!
Lucius flies off his feet and dr ops in a heap.
BELLATRIX
You dirty litt le monkey!  You 
could have killed me!
Harry turns, sees Bellatrix ragi ng at Dobby.  The elf 
stands fearlessly  across from  her, defiant.
DOBBY
Dobby meant on ly to maim or 
seriously injure,  not kill.12.
CONTINUED: (2)170 170
(CONTINUED)BELLATRIX
For God’s sake, Cissy, you’ve got 
a wand!  Use it!
Narcissa hesitate s.  Crack! -- Dobb y waves h is little 
fist and Narci ssa’s wand flies from her hand.
BELLATRIX
How dare you take  a witch’s wand.  
How dare you d efy your masters.
DOBBY
Dobby has no mast er!  Dobby is a 
free elf, and Dob by has come to 
save Harry Potter and his friends!
Harry tosses R on a wand, grab s Hermione’s be aded bag and 
joins the othe rs in the center of the room. 
HARRY
Give the Dark Lor d our regards.
Harry’s hand clos es on Dobby’s and the drawing room 
begins to SPIN.  Bellatrix’s face twis ts into an ugly 
blur.  Her arm ri ses, dagger in hand.  There is a flash 
of SILVER.  Then...
All goes BLACK .  For a long time.  Then...
EXT. CLIFF - SHELL COTTAGE - DAWN (SECONDS LATER) 171 171
... with a gre at WHOOSH, Harry and the others tumble onto 
solid earth and h ear the CRASH of WAVES.  As  Harry 
staggers to his feet, stars whir l above him.  He sees he 
is on a cliff overlooking a dark  sea.  Ron h olds Hermione 
gently.  Tears st ing her eyes.
HARRY
It’s all right, H ermione.  You’re 
safe.  We’r e all safe.
She doesn’t respond, nor Ron.  Then Harry reali zes they 
are looking past him, even Griphook , the sword hanging 
limply in his hand.  Harry turns.  Dob by stands alone, a 
queer smile on his face, hand  over his heart , the hilt of 
Bellatrix’s dagge r protruding be tween his fingers.
HARRY
Dobby... no...
As Harry rushes to him, the e lf crumples in his  arms, his 
eyes rolling up to the stars.13.

(CONTINUED)HARRY
It’s okay... Here ... Just hold on, 
Dobby... I’ll fix you -- Hermione 
-- your bag -- you must have 
something -- Esse nce of Dittany -- 
something... Hermione!  Help me!
She merely stands , tears streaki ng her cheeks.
DOBBY
Such a beautif ul night... to be 
with friends.  Dobby  is happy... 
to be with his friend... Harry 
Potter...
Dobby gives a lit tle shudder, then goes still.  The 
others simply stare, mute, liste ning to the waves 
thunder.
Footfalls sound.  Ron turns, sees h is brother B ill and 
Luna approaching fro m the cottage in  the distance.
BILL
Fleur’s seeing to  Ollivander.  
Anyone else need tending --
He eyes Harry curiou sly, crouched, his back tur ned.  Then 
sees Dobby’s limp li ttle legs dangling lifelessly.  As 
the others watch,  Harry reach es out and --  gently as he 
can -- pulls the dagger from Dobby’s chest, the n shrugs 
off his jacket and enwraps th e elf’s body.  Slowly, his 
shoulders begin to shake.  Only Luna dares to step 
forward.  Kneelin g, she sees Harry is silently crying.
LUNA
We should close his eyes.  Don’t 
you think?
Luna reaches o ut, tenderly places her fin gers upon 
Dobby’s eyelids and closes them.
LUNA
There.  Now he co uld be sleeping.
She turns then, looks at Harry.
LUNA
Harry.  It’s all rig ht.  That it 
hurts.  That’s wh at reminds us how 
lucky we are to be alive.
Harry turns, s tudies her sere ne face briefly , then his 
eyes shift to Dobby,  his face serene as  well, in death.14.

Without magic.

A SPADE pierces t he earth as Harry beg ins to dig, 
fiercely obsessed  by his task.  A moment lat er, Ron 
kneels beside him and begins to do the same, then 
Hermione.  CAMERA  RISES and the THU NDERING OCEAN comes

LUNA
It’s beautiful here.
BILL
It was our Aunt’ s.  We used to 
come here as kids.  The Order uses 
it now as a sa fe house -- what’s 
left of us, at least.
Luna ponders this , then taps the  chime again.
LUNA
Muggles think the se keep evil 
away.  But the y’re wrong...
Bill studies her curiously.  The n Harry appears in the 
doorway with Ron and Hermione.
HARRY
I need to talk to the goblin.
INT. SHELL COTTAGE - BEDROOM 2 - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 181 181
A KNOCK sounds.  Gri phook turns, watches Bill push open 
the door, step  aside for H arry, Ron and H ermione.  Harry 
waits for Bill to withdraw.  Turns to Griphook.
HARRY
How are you?
GRIPHOOK
Alive.15.
CONTINUED: (2)171 171
(CONTINUED)HARRY
You probably d on’t remember --
GRIPHOOK
-- that I showed you to your vault 
the first time  you visited 
Gringotts?  Even amongst goblins, 
you are famous, Harry Potter.
(nodding to the 
window)
You buried the el f.  I saw you.
HARRY
Yes.
GRIPHOOK
And brought  me here.
Griphook studies him curiously.
GRIPHOOK
You are a very  unusual wizard.
HARRY
Why did you le ave Gringotts?
GRIPHOOK
Soon the Death Ea ters will control 
it.  That was una cceptable to me.
RON
Then you’re on  our side.
GRIPHOOK
This is a wizard’s war.  I take no 
side.
HARRY
I need to get ins ide Gringotts,  
into one of the vaults.
GRIPHOOK
It is impossible.
HARRY
Alone, yes.  With you, no.
Griphook stares impassively at him, silent.  He  glances 
at the Sword of Gryffindor, which s tands in the corner.
GRIPHOOK
How did you co me by this sword?16.
CONTINUED:181 181
(CONTINUED)HARRY
It’s complicated.   Why did 
Bellatrix Lest range think it 
should be in  her vault at 
Gringotts?
GRIPHOOK
It’s complicated.
Harry and the goblin stare at  each other, as  if testing 
one another.  Fin ally, Harry speaks:
HARRY
The sword present ed itself to us 
in a moment of ne ed.  We didn’t 
steal it.
Griphook nods, pondering this.
GRIPHOOK
There is a sword in Madam 
Lestrange’s vault  identical to 
this one, but it is a fake.  It 
was placed there thi s past summer.
HARRY
And she nev er suspected?
GRIPHOOK
The replica is very convincing.  
Only a goblin wou ld recognize that 
this is the true Sword of 
Gryffindor.
RON
Who put it there?   The fake.
GRIPHOOK
It was not my place to ask, nor 
did I desire to.  There are more 
than a few curiou s things in the 
vaults at Gringotts.
HARRY
And in Madam Lest range’s vault as 
well?
GRIPHOOK
Perhaps.
HARRY
I have gold.  Lots of it.
GRIPHOOK
I have no inte rest in gold.17.

Then what?
The goblin twists  the curl at his chin... th en his eyes 
drift once again to the sword.  Harry starts to respond, 
but the goblin cuts him off w ith finality.
GRIPHOOK
That is my price.
HARRY
(a beat)
All right.
Ron and Hermione look shocked.
GRIPHOOK
I have your word,  Harry Potter, 
that you will give me the Sword of 
Gryffindor if I help you?
Griphook extends his hand.  Harry reaches ou t, takes it.
EXT. SHELL COTTAGE - HALLWAY - D AY (MOMENTS LATER) 182 182
The trio walk.  Hermione WHISPERS.
HERMIONE
Harry, are you th inking there’s a 
Horcrux in Bellat rix’s vault?
HARRY
She was ter rified when she thought 
we’d been in t here.  She kept 
asking you wha t else we’d  taken.  
I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux 
there.  If we find it, we can kill 
it.  And if we kill it, we’re one 
step closer to  killing him.
RON
And if we find one?  How’re we 
supposed to de stroy it if we’ve 
given Griphook the sword?
HARRY
I’m still working  on that part.
FLEUR exits the room ahead, a half-emp ty bowl in hand.  
Seeing Harry, she  stops, effectively barring  the door.
FLEUR
He’s too weak.18.

Ollivander rolls his  sunken eyes toward the tri o as they 
enter.  Attempts a feeble smile.
OLLIVANDER
Forgive me if I don’t get up.
HARRY
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you 
a few questions.
OLLIVANDER
Anything, m’ boy, anything.
HARRY
Can you identify these, sir?
Harry removes TWO WANDS.  Ollivander take s one in hand.
OLLIVANDER
Walnut and dragon  heartstring.  
Twelve and three qua rter inches.  
Unyielding.  T his belongs to 
Bellatrix Lestrange.
HARRY
And this?
OLLIVANDER
Hawthorn.  Unicor n hair.  Ten 
inches.  Reasonab ly pliant.  This 
was the wand of  Draco Malfoy.
HARRY
Was?  Isn’t it still?
OLLIVANDER
Perhaps not -- if  you won it from 
him.  I sense its  allegiance has 
changed.
HARRY
You talk about wa nds like they’ve 
got feelings.  Can think.
OLLIVANDER
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. 
Potter.  That much has always been 
clear to those of  us who have 
studied wandlore.19.
CONTINUED:182 182
(CONTINUED)Harry nods, po ndering the wand that Ollivand er returns to 
him, then speaks:
HARRY
What do you know about the Deathly 
Hallows, sir?
Ollivander eyes H arry with surprise.  And a hint of fear.
OLLIVANDER
There are rumored to be three:  
The Elder Wand, the Resurrection 
Stone and the Inv isibility Cloak.  
It is said that to possess them 
all is to make oneself the  Master 
of Death.  But fe w truly believe 
such objects exist --
HARRY
But you, sir?  Do you believe they 
exist?
OLLIVANDER
I see no reason to put stock in an 
old wives tale --
HARRY
You’re lying.  Yo u know one exists 
and you told him about it.  You 
told him about  the Elder Wand and 
where to go looking for it.
OLLIVANDER
He tortured me !  Besides, I 
conveyed on ly rumors.  There’s no 
guarantee he w ill find it --
HARRY
He has foun d it, sir.
Ollivander blinks.  Ashen.  Stunned.
HARRY
That’s all, sir.  We’ll leave you 
to get some  rest now.
The trio begin s to exit.
OLLIVANDER
He’s after you, Mr. Potter.  If 
it’s true, what y ou say, that he 
has the Elder Wand, I’m afraid you 
really don’t s tand a chance.20.
CONTINUED:183 183
(CONTINUED)HARRY
Then I guess I’ll just have to 
kill him before he  finds me, sir.
INT. SHELL COTTAGE - PARLOR - NIGHT 184 184
A FIRE CRACKLES.  Harry toys with t he SNITCH Dumbledore 
bequeathed him.
RON
You’re sure  it’s hers?
Harry looks up , sees Ron t urning a STRAND OF HAIR in the 
firelight.
HERMIONE
Positive.
Harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he 
showed Ollivander  -- and extends the longest  to Hermione.
HARRY
I reckon you s hould take this 
then.
HERMIONE
Can’t I use the other?
RON
You heard Olli vander.  It’s 
Harry’s now.
HERMIONE
But I hate that t hing -- that’s 
the wand that killed Sirius!  How can I hold it and  not feel...
HARRY
If I can hold it, you can.
Hermione looks him in t he eye, then takes it.
RON
How will we know what it is when 
we get in ther e?  After all, a 
Horcrux can be  anything.
HARRY
I’ll know.  I can’t  explain.  It’s 
like...
(touching his chest)
... they sing to me.
Hermione and R on exchange a trou bled glance. 21.

That’s a bit scary.
HERMIONE
It is, Harry.  Di d Dumbledore ever

that might exp lain why --
HARRY
No.  I just know.   When one’s 
near.
Hermione and R on stare at him, silent, when a FLOORBOARD 
SQUEAKS.  They tu rn, watch SHADOWS appear:  Bill and 
Fleur.  Fleur hands Hermione a LONG BL ACK WOMAN’S CLOAK.
FLEUR
This is the closest I could find 
to what you de scribed, Hermione.
HERMIONE
It’s perfect.  Thank you, Fleur.
Fleur lays the cloak in Hermione’s hands, then steps back 
next to Bill.  He studies the trio.
BILL
You’re leaving , aren’t you.
HARRY
In the morning.
BILL
And Griphook?
HARRY
He’ll be leaving too.
Bill nods, staring o ff briefly.  Then:
BILL
Listen, I don’t k now what you’re 
up to, but I know  goblins.  If 
you’ve struck any  kind of bargain 
with Griphook, yo u must be 
exceptionally careful to live up 
to it.  If you do n’t... he won’t 
be forgiving.
The trio sits in silence.  Wa tches Bill with draw.  Harry 
glances down at his palm again, at the Snitch.22.

The ocean crashes .  Harry crouches by Dobby’s fresh 
grave, which n ow bears a simple STONE:  “Here Lies Dobby, 
A Free Elf.”  Harry ponders the mir ror shard, turning it 
from sky to sea when:
LUNA (O.S.)
The sky has lost a star.
Luna’s image skit ters across the mi rror’s surface and 
Harry looks up, finds her standing there clutching a 
small TRAVELING BAG, staring at Dobby’s stone.
LUNA
My father used to  say that when a 
child died.
She looks up, smiles.
LUNA
Funny how Mr. Dob by knew exactly 
where to find us.
HARRY
Yeah.  Funny.  Listen, Luna, about 
your father, I don’ t want you to 
think I --
LUNA
I know you und erstand why my 
father did what he  did, Harry.  
That’s why we don’t  need to talk 
about it.
She continues to smile.  Harry eyes  the trav eling bag.
HARRY
Hogwarts?
She nods, look s to the sea.
HARRY
It’s not the p lace you left, you 
know.  It’s not the same.
LUNA
Neither am I.
She gives a little wave, still bearing the trace of a 
smile, then DISAP PARATES and is gone.
RON (O.S.)
Always good value.  I’ll  miss her.23.
(CONTINUED)Harry turns, sees Ron standing nearby.  He  has BROWN 
HAIR.
RON
What d’you think?  
HARRY
Wouldn’t know you if I didn’t know 
you.
Ron studies the mirror as Harry turns it over in his 
palm. 
RON
You want to tell me what that is?
HARRY
Sirius gave it to  me.  He had a 
matching piece.  He said if I ever 
needed him, all I had to do was 
look into it.
RON
You mean he could see you?
HARRY
Something like th at.  I don’t 
know.  He died before I ever got 
to use it.  Th e thing is...
RON
Go on.
HARRY
You’ll think I’ m mental, but more 
than once, when I’ve  looked into 
it -- I think I’ve seen 
Dumbledore.
As Ron reacts, Ha rry’s eyes shift.  Bellatrix Lestrange 
and Griphook, clutching the swor d, approach from the 
cottage.
RON
Bloody hell... that’s a sight.
BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
Well, how do I look?
RON
Hideous.

Oh dear, I missed  a spot, didn’t

Hermione casts Be llatrix’s malevolent gaze upon him.
RON
Never mind.  I’m good.

her)
That is you in there, isn’t it?
Harry eyes Gripho ok, who is s tudying the sword.
HARRY
You can give that to He rmione to

Hermione extends the beaded bag.   Griphook e yes Harry and 
then, grudgingly,  lets the sword  drop within.

WARLOCK passes.
WARLOCK
Madam Lestrange.
BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)

Good morning.
The Warlock ey es her oddly, then continue s on.  As

Hey.  Easy.

HERMIONE
He’s right.  I was being stupid.
Harry pulls the Invisibility Cloak fro m his coat, tosses 
it to Ron.
HARRY
C’mon.  Let’s do it.
A GUST of WIND BLOWS  and we SHIFT TO  a FADING POSTER of

A vast marble hall.  A long counter.  Gob lins perched on 
high stools.  WIZ ARD GUARDS p ositioned throu ghout.  As 
Ron and Hermione enter, WIND whistl es through the 
doorway, sends the PAGES of the Gob lin’s massiv e ledgers 
trembling.  As the door close s, the room ret urns to its 
eerie silence.  Hermione glances  at Ron.  He  nods and she 
steps to the long counter, where an AGED GOBLIN scribbles 
in his ledger.

AGED GOBLIN

won’t you?
The goblin slips off  his stool, goes to consult with 
another, even mor e ancient goblin (BOGROD).
BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
I don’t like to be kept waiting.
Hermione’s tone is harsh, authorita tive.  She turns to 
Ron, raises an eyebrow.  He nods, mouths “Well done,” 
then looks away, eyeing  the guards statio ned about the 
room.  One looks up, meets  his gaze. 
TALL GOBLIN
Next.
Ron turns, sees the Tall Gobl in eyeing him.
BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
He’s with me.
(with utter disdain)
As difficult as t hat may be to

Ron frowns, ta kes in the s cene again.  Th e SCRATCH of 
goblin quills seems to grow l ouder.  Ron fidgets, eyes 
the guard agai n, who is looki ng at him more clo sely now.  
Ron runs a fin ger under his collar, shifts his eyes to 
the Aged Goblin w ho continues to co nsult with the one 
known as Bogro d.  Bogrod says  something a nd they both 
glance at Hermione.
Then GRIPHOOK’S VOICE HISSES in his ear:
GRIPHOOK (V.O.)

Ron stiffens, tur ns slightly toward the empty s pot to his

BOGROD
Madam Lestrang e.  Would you mind 
presenting you r wand?
BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
And why should  I do that?
Just then, the guard  across the roo m begins to walk 
toward Ron.  Ron’ s eyes dance.  He averts his face, 
WHISPERS:
RON
Harry, what do we do?  Harry...?
No response.  Ron  extends his hand as casually as he can, 
finds only empty spa ce.  We -- 
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE
CAMERA MOVING TOWARDS Hermione, sim ulating Harry’s 
movement to ward her.
BOGROD
It’s the bank’s p olicy.  I’m sure 
you understand, g iven the current

BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
No, I most certai nly do not 
understand -- 
Sensing Harry’s pres ence, she falters,  her own voice 
emerging throu gh Bellatrix’s.  Bogr od eyes her intensely.
BOGROD
I’m afraid I must insist.
As the guard c loses on Ron, Ron loo ks about frantically, 
reaching for his wand when a GUST of W IND fills the Hall, 
sending the ledgers trembling again .  The guard 
approaching Ron shifts his gaze briefly to the entrance,

AGED GOBLIN
But... Bogrod, there have been 
special instructions  regarding the 
Lestrange vault.
BOGROD
I’m fully aware of  that.  I’m also 
aware the Lestran ges are one of 
our oldest and most respected 
families. 
AGED GOBLIN
Yes, sir, but our instructions  are 
very specific --
BOGROD
Let me be specific  with you, 
Ricbert.  I’ve ru n this bank for 
forty-five years,  long before 
anyone had even h eard of a Death 
Eater.  The day m ay come that they 
feel they can run this place 
better than me, but that day has 
not yet arrived.  Am I understood!
The Aged Goblin h esitates, then nods.  Bogrod turns to 
Hermione.
BOGROD
Madam, if you will, I will escort 
you myself.
(to the guard)
Teffington, see to that door, will you.
The guard glances at Ron, then reluctantly h eads for the

the cart. 
HARRY
How long before they come after 
us?
GRIPHOOK
Time will tell.
Harry’s eyes meet Griphook’s in the flickering darkness, 
then Ron’s face appears over Har ry’s shoulder.
RON
What’s that ?  Up ahead.
Ron points.  In the distance, directly over the tracks, 
something SHIMMER S like a CURTAI N of WATER.
GRIPHOOK

Furiously, Griphook sta rts to throw le vers, trying to 
slow the cart.
HARRY
What is that, Griphook?
The wheels SCR EECH, throwing off SPARKS.
HARRY
Griphook!  What is that!
He doesn’t answer , furiously pre occupied with the cart.  
Harry turns to He rmione, hoping she has an explanation, 
but she just shak es her head, st aring up ahead as...
... Griphook slum ps back, powerless, w atching in grim 
resignation as the cart caree ns wildly down the rail and 
PIERCES the sh immering curtain.
Instantly, water ENGULF S them with FEROCI OUS POWER.  The 
seats beneath them collapse, flippi ng downward and...
They drop.

wand.
HARRY
Well done.  Hey.

Something massive shifts heavily.  CHAINS CLINK.  He

his feet he mo ves upward, beads of sweat trailing over 
his forehead.  Suddenly, halfway up, he SLIPS and --

plants the flesh of his palm against t he shifting slope.

CASCADING down onto Ron, Herm ione and Gripho ok in a small 
avalanche.

Harry climbs fast er -- the sound DEAFENING, objects 
CLANGING off one another -- until, finally, he stops just

We have a d eal, Griphook.
Griphook looks up.  A kind of ma dness burns in his eyes.
GRIPHOOK
I said I’d get yo u in.  I never 
said anything abo ut getting you 
out.
Pivoting swiftly,  he SLAMS Bogrod’s hand to the door and 
as it melts, H arry, Ron and H ermione ride an  avalanche of 
silver and gold into the o uter chamber.
INT. OUTSIDE LEST RANGE VAULT - DAY 196 196
As the trio find their feet, the drago n ROARS and SPITS 
FIRE, illuminatin g the tunnel.  SHADOWS APPROACH, 
stretching over the tunnel wa lls:  GRINGOTTS GOBLINS and 
GUARDS.
HARRY
Griphook!  Griphook!
But Griphook mere ly looks back, grins mad ly and, sword in 
hand, rushes to join the approaching throng.
GRIPHOOK
Thieves!  H elp!  Thieves!
RON
Foul little git.  Least we’ve got 
Bogrod.
The dragon SPITS aga in, reducing Bo grod to dust.
RON
That’s unfortunate.36.

RON
You’re asking us?  You’re the

HERMIONE
I’ve got something.  But it’s mad.
Harry and Ron eye the approaching t hrong, turn back to  
Hermione with loo ks of mild panic.  Steeling herself, she  
raises her wand. 
HERMIONE 
Relashio!
The IRON CUFFS on the dragon snap free.
RON
That’s your idea?
HARRY
Come on!
Harry fires stunn ing spells toward the goblins as he 
pelts toward t he dragon and f lings himself onto  its neck.  
Hermione and R on jump up behind.  The dragon doesn’t 
move.
HERMIONE
It doesn’t rea lize it’s free!

Leviosa!  Avia tus!  Ex Cappa!
Nothing.  Ron and  Harry glance at each  other and then -- 
as if reading eac h other’s mind -- raise their wands high 
and, as one, JAB the dragon with the t ip of their wands.  
It ROARS, rear s, and soars in to the air.  As  it caroms 
off the sides of the  tunnel and scrape s the ceiling, the 
trio duck, watching the  goblins scatter l ike skittles and 
dust and debris rain down.  Harry l ooks back, sees the 
dragon’s SPIKED TAIL TH RASHING, the tu nnel caving.

The dragon soars over London, shedding scale s and debris

RON
That was brilliant!  BRILLIANT!
Ron looks down, r ealizes he’s on a dragon, several 
hundred feet in the air.  Goes a bit green.
RON
Bloody hell.

Dust still hangs in the  air.  Those Go blins that survived

Griphook.Clutching the swo rd of Gryffindor, he bumps past his 
dazed brethren, taking an agitated glance over his

encircle his boot.  VOLDEMORT, ELDER WAND clutched in his 
bony hand, speaks in PARSELTONGUE to Najini:
VOLDEMORT
The boy has disco vered our secret, 
Nagini.  We must find out just how  
much he knows.  We must return to

A RAPID SUCCESSION OF  IMAGES FLASH:  Dumbledore’s DESK

I saw him.
HERMIONE
You let him in !  Harry, you

HARRY
I can’t always he lp it, Hermione!
(frowning)
Maybe I can.  I don’t know.  
RON
Never mind!  W hat did you see?
HARRY
He’s angry.  But he’s scared too.  
He’s going to make sure the other 
Horcruxes are safe.
RON
What happens when he finds out 
four are gone?
HARRY
I reckon he’ll do anything to stop 
us from finding t he rest.  There’s 
more:  one of the m’s at Hogwarts.
HERMIONE/RON
What?
HERMIONE
You saw it?
HARRY
I saw the castle.   And Rowena  
Ravenclaw.  I think it must have

breaks loose.
RON
‘Fraid he’s right.  One problem:  
Snape’s Headmaster n ow.  We can’t 
just walk in the front door.
HARRY
We’ll go to Hogsmeade.  To 
Honeydukes.  T ake the secret 
passage in the  cellar.
Harry looks off then, over th e lake, in t he direction the 
dragon flew off.
HARRY
There’s something wrong with him.  In the past, I co uld always follow 
his thoughts.  Now everything 
feels di sconnected.
RON
Maybe it’s bec ause of the 
Horcruxes.  Maybe  he’s growing 
weaker.  Maybe  he’s dying.
HARRY
No.  It’s more li ke he’s wounded.  
If anything, he  feels more 
dangerous.

HERMIONE
No, you’ll giv e us away.
The night grows darker, the s treetlights dim.  The trio’s 
breath drifts visibly in the gather ing chill.  As the 
Dementors desc end, the trio grimace, bese t by bleak 
thoughts.  A tear escapes Hermione’ s eye, trails down her 
cheek.  Finall y, Harry can ta ke it no more.

A SILVER STAG bursts  from his wand and  charges down the

He looks up.  For  a moment, there’s no response, then:
LUNA
Well, there’s Row ena Ravenclaw’s  
lost diadem.
RON
(under his breath)
Oh, bloody hel l.  Here we go.
LUNA
The lost diadem of Ravenclaw?  
Hasn’t anyone ever heard of it?  
It’s quite famous.
CHO
Yes, but Lu na, it’s lost.  For 
centuries now.  There’s not a 
person alive today who’s seen it.
Her fellow Rav enclaws nod.  Ron frowns.
RON
Excuse me.  But w ould someone tell 
me:  what’s a bloody diadem?
CHO
It’s a kind of crown.  You know, 
like a tiara.
As she says this, Harry frowns, try ing to think if he’s 
seen such a thing in the castle.
CHO
Ravenclaw’s was r umored to have 
magical properties, to enhance the 
wisdom of the wearer. 53.

Hey there.
Ron smiles, about to speak, then no tices Ginny’s eyes

Six months she  hasn’t seen me and

As the Grffindors walk, Harry moves in their midst, 
effectively sh ielded.  Harry slips pas t a few people, 
reaches out and.. . enfolds Ginny ’s hand in h is own.  She 
doesn’t look back , knows it’s hi m, knows his touch.
INT. GREAT HALL - SAME TIME - NIGHT 230 230
Each House stands together as a group, the room  buzzing.  
No one sits.  Har ry is nowhere to be seen.  At the Tall 
Table at the top of the Hall two  DEATH EATERS -- AMYCUS 
AND ALECTO CARROW  -- stand like sin ister sentinels , their 
eyes raking the c rowd.  PROFESSOR M cGONAGALL, her face 
ashen, her bearin g reduced, s tands along the right wall, 
while Flitwick stands by the left w all.  As Snape enters, 
the room goes slowly silent.  
SNAPE
Many of you are surely wondering 
why I have summon ed you here at 
this hour.  It ha s come to my 
attention that  earlier this 
evening... Harry Potter was 
sighted in Hogsmeade.
A MURMURED THRILL fi lls the Hall.  McGonagall’s eyes 
glisten with curi osity.  Snape raises his vo ice, briefly, 
to quell the n oise in the Hall.
SNAPE
I mention this  in the hopes that 
truth will not be supplanted by 
rumor.  55.
(MORE)(CONTINUED)For myself and a few select 
members of the staff this comes as 
little surp rise.  We have, for 
some time, considere d Mr. Potter’s 
return to Hogwarts to be not only 
possible but inevitable.  
Consequently, in the  past several 
months and und er my specific 
direction, exhaus tive defensive 
strategies hav e been employed to 
defeat any attemp t Mr. Potter 
might make to breach  these walls.  
But know this.  Should anyone -- 
student or staff  -- attempt to 
aid Mr. Potter, t hat person will 
be punished in a manner consistent 
with the severity  of their 
transgression.  Rest assured:  So 
long as I am H eadmaster at 
Hogwarts, Harry P otter will never 
again step foot in  this castle.
As APPLAUSE erupts from the Slytherins, Mais y Reynolds,  
glowers over at them .  Snape raises a hand.  The room 
returns to silence.
SNAPE
Now then.  If anyone here has 
knowledge of Mr. Potter’s 
movements this ev ening... I invite 
them to step f orward now.
Snape’s eyes rake the Hall.  Dead s ilence.  A nervous 
shift of glances.   And then...
FOOTSTEPS.
A FIGURE appears in the shadows at the back of the Hall.  
McGonagall’s chin rises in disbelie f.  Maisy’s face 
blooms with hope.   And then...
HARRY (O.S.)
I think I can hel p you out with 
that...
... Harry appears.  
HARRY
It would seem tha t, despite your 
exhaustive defensive  strategies, 
you have a bit  of a security 
problem, Headmaster.
Snape stares in s tunned disbelie f, then his gaze shifts 
as one by one, ot hers emerge:  Ron.  Hermion e.  Lupin.  56.

HARRY
And I’m afraid it’s rather 
extensive.
The Carrows, who had been moving to wards Harry,  falter, 
turn to Snape with u ncertainty.  Ha rry’s eyes narrow with 
malice as he stares at Snape.
HARRY
How dare you stand where he stood.
Snape watches Har ry draw his wand, point it at him.
HARRY
Tell them how it was  that night.  
Tell then how you  looked him in 
the eye, a man wh o trusted you... 
and killed him.  Tell them!
Snape’s eyes find Harry’s, but his fac e remains a mask.  
McGonagall stands  poised, no lon ger an ashen ghost.  
Flitwick’s hand twitches over his wand.  The  air prickles 
with anticipation.
Snape moves as if to retrieve hi s wand.  McG onagall steps 
forward and sends  a VOLCANIC BLAST Snape’s way.  
Pivoting, he parries the spell -- bare ly -- and se nds it 
RICOCHETING ar ound the room.
CHAOS ensues.  Fl itwick and the res t of the staff --
inspired by Harry and McGonagall -- leap forth, wands 
out.  Snape, o utnumbered, standing at the epicenter, 
parries spell after spell with asto nishing skill 
deflecting two of the curs es into Alecto and Amycus 
Carrow.Snape takes th e measure of the room and sweeps his wand 
over his head, reducing the T ORCHES that line the wall to 
SMOKE and pitchin g the Hall into total DARKNESS.
As STUDENTS SCREA M, a GREAT WHOOSHI NG sound fills the 
Hall and some flying  thing flickers past the windows, 
RATTLING the PANES b efore BLASTING through one.
Instantly, the to rches BURST back to  life and we see that 
it’s McGonagall, wand raised aloft, who’s done it.  In 
the moonlight, Harry can see a BATLIKE CREATURE beating 
into the night.  McGonagall peers b itterly into the 
darkness.57.

Coward!  COWARD!  And he didn’t

(turning to Harry)
Mr. Potter, do yo u mind telling me 
what you’re doing here, which, I 
trust you realize , is an act of 
complete and utter lunacy?
HARRY
I’m a Gryffindor.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
I thought it migh t have something 
to do with that.
(turning to the room)
All right!  Settl e down!  Settle 
down!
The room quiets.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
It appears that y our Headmaster, 
to use the common  phrase, has done 
a bunk.
CHEERS RISE from all Houses save Slytherin, where PANSY 
PARKINSON glowers along with Bla ise and G oyle.  Even 
McGonagall can’t help but smile.  Just then, Harry WINCES 
slightly, pressin g his fingers to  his temple.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Potter...
A slow RUMBLING fills the Hall.  Harry, fingers trembling 
with pain, glances u p, sees DARK CLOUD S coagulating in 
the Enchanted Ceiling.  McGon agall follows his gaze, as 
do others, wat ching as the cl ouds shift e erily, like 
blots of blood.
Suddenly the FLAM ES in the torches along the walls 
TREMBLE as a CHILL BREEZE consumes the room.  The Hall 
slowly DIMS.  All  grows progressive ly silent when...
... a GIRL SCREAMS, her voice rising and rising.  Harry 
rushes through the throng, the students part ing as he 
pelts forwards, p ushing past them u ntil he finds...
... Maisy, coweri ng on the floor  in the corner, hands 
over her ears, ey es clenched tight.  She seems possessed. 
Everyone watches,  chilled.  F inally Harry st arts to move 
forward, when he himself WINCES, pressing his fingers to 
his temples.  Ano ther person SCREAMS some where in the 
Hall, then another.  Harry glances about him , at the 
circle of faces in  his vicinity.  58.
CONTINUED: (3)230 230
(CONTINUED)All are a mirror image of Maisy now, g rimacing in pain.  
Harry stares, con fused, stricken with pain, when...
... a VOICE BLOOMS in h is head in a DEATHLY WHISPER.
VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
I know that many of you will want  
to fight.  Some of you may even 
think this wise.  But this is 
folly.   
We WEAVE THROU GH the room, taking in the fac es, listening 
in mute misery as Voldemort speaks.  G inny, Hermione, 
Ron, Fred, George, S eamus... on and on.
VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
I wish you no harm.  I have great 
respect for the students of 
Hogwarts.  I was once one myself 
after all.  I ask  for but one 
thing and if g ranted no magical 
blood shall be spilt...
For a moment they stand , hung in  silence...
VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
Give me Harry Potter .  Do this and 
none shall be harmed .  Give me 
Harry Potter and I shall leave 
Hogwarts untouche d.  Give me Harry 
Potter and you will be rewarded.
With that, the wh isper recedes and those in the Hall 
slowly surface back into the prickling ambience of the 
here and now.  Above them, th e clouds evapor ate in the 
Enchanted Ceiling.  And then, like iro n filings flaking 
to the surface of a magnet, e very eye finds...
Harry.
For a moment, sil ence.  Then, Pansy Parkinson jabs her 
finger at Harry.
PANSY PARKINSON
But he’s there!  Potter’s there!  
Someone grab him!
Instinctively, Ginny steps in front of Harry, wand drawn.  
Then, as one, the Gryffindors assemble in a line and face 
towards the Sl ytherins, shielding H arry.  Momen ts later, 
the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs do t he same.  Harry’s eyes 
glitter at the sight , moved.  Ginny lowers her wand.

FILCH
Oh.  Sorry, mum.
Filch begins to  turn away.

Wait!  As it turn s out, Mr. Filch,

If you would, I’d like you to lead

FILCH

Er, exactly where is it I’d be

CHEERS rise again and McGonag all’s eyes turn  on Harry.  
She rises up to full  height, her jaw firm. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
I presume you hav e a reason for 
returning, Potter.  What is it you

HARRY
Time.  As much as  you can give me.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Do what you have to do.  I’ll 
secure the castle.
HARRY

HARRY
Yes.  That’s righ t.  But I can

it once and for a ll.  But only if 
you tell me where he hid it.  You

Helena?  You just have to tell me.  Please.

Ron and Her mione wait.

He does.
Harry looks up then, meets their eyes:

Ollivander himself said it.

The Dark Lord wil l return.  And 
the boy will be in  terrible danger 
when he does.
Snape stares once more at the sk y beyond.  Then, softly:
SNAPE
No one can kno w.  Your word.
DUMBLEDORE
My word that I sh all never reveal 
the best of you, Severus?  If you 
insist.
Snape continues to s tare at the sky.  We DRIFT TO it.  It 
FILLS the S CREEN and we TILT DOWN...
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY 323 323
... TO Snape and Dumbledore walking.
SNAPE
He exhibits no measurable talent.  
His arrogance riv als even his 
father’s.  And he  seems to relish 
his fame.
DUMBLEDORE
Sometimes we see what we expect to 
see, Severus.  Ot her teachers 
indicate the boy is modest, 
likeable and whil e no prodigy, 
possesses above-a verage gifts.  
Personally, I fin d him rather 
engaging.
SNAPE
You see what y ou want to see.
Severus walks on.  Dumbledore smiles with amusement.
DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps.  O h.  Severus.
(as he stops)
Keep an eye on Pr ofessor Quirrell, 
won’t you?103.

A FEVERISH, SE MICONSCIOUS Dumble dore raises his  left hand 
and tips a GOB LET of GOLDEN POTION over h is lips while 
Snape ministers to  his right hand, whi ch is BLACKENED.  A 
RING lies upon  the desk before them.
SNAPE
Why did you put it  on?  Surely you 
realized it ca rried a curse.
DUMBLEDORE
I was... fooli sh... greedy...
SNAPE
Drink the rest.  It will contain 
the curse to the hand for the time 
being.
Dumbledore’s eyes open, examine his damaged fingers.
DUMBLEDORE
For the tim e being?
SNAPE
It will spread.
DUMBLEDORE
How long?
SNAPE
Maybe a year.
Dumbledore nods, smiles.
DUMBLEDORE
Well, this makes mat ters much more 
straightforward.
Snape studies Dum bledore briefly, looks away.
DUMBLEDORE
Do not igno re me, Severus.   Was it 
not you who told me of Lord 
Voldemort’s pl an to have the 
Malfoy boy murder me?
SNAPE
It is not expecte d that he will 
succeed.
DUMBLEDORE
But should he fai l, one would 
presume the Dark Lord will turn 
to... you.104.
(CONTINUED)Snape does not respond.
DUMBLEDORE
You must agree.
Snape stares in horror at Dumbledore.  Dumbledore nods.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.  You must be  the one to kill 
me, Severus.  It is the only way.  
Only then will th e Dark Lord trust 
you completely.
SNAPE
You ask too much.
DUMBLEDORE
(thundering)
Too much!  Nothing I could ask is 
too much.  You know what is at 
stake!  You mo re than anyone!
Snape says not hing.  Dumbledore sit s back, painfully 
studies his hand.
DUMBLEDORE
There will come a time when Harry 
Potter must be told something.  
But you must wait  until Voldemort 
is at his m ost vulnerable.
SNAPE
Tell him what?
DUMBLEDORE
On the night Lord  Voldemort went 
to Godric’s Hollow to kill Harry, 
and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the cu rse rebounded.  
When that happ ened, a part  of Lord 
Voldemort’s soul latched itself 
onto the only liv ing thing it 
could find:  Harry himself.
Snape stares in  disbelief.  Dumbledore nods.
DUMBLEDORE
There’s a reason Harry can speak 
with snakes.  There’ s a reason he 
can look into Lord Voldemort’s 
mind.  A part of Lord Voldemort 
lives inside him.105.
CONTINUED:324 324
(CONTINUED)SNAPE
So when the time comes, the boy 
must die.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.  And Voldemo rt himself must 
do it.  That is essential.
Snape nods, po ndering all of thi s.  His voic e is bitter.
SNAPE
You’ve kept him alive so that he 
can die at the pr oper moment.  
You’ve been raisi ng him like a pig 
for slaughter.
DUMBLEDORE
But this is to uching, Severus.  
Don’t tell me you’v e grown to care 
for the boy?
Snape eyes Dumbledore f iercely, then:
SNAPE
Expecto Patronum!
A blast of LIGHT bursts  from his wand, soars out the 
window:  a SILVER DOE.
DUMBLEDORE
Lily.  After all this time?
SNAPE
Always...
We GO TO BLACK...
FADE IN:
INT. PORTER HO USE - BEDROOM - NI GHT (YEARS PAST) 325 325
In the f.g., a BA BY FIDGETS in its cri b.  We see Snape 
enter the room, g lance at the ba by, then down toward the 
floor.  He stands, u tterly still... th en his face creases 
with pain.Lily lies in profile , eyes open but em pty, staring toward 
the ceiling.  Her chest is still.  Snape leans dow n and, 
cradling her, beg ins to weep...
DUMBLEDORE (V.O.)
The irony of cour se, Severus, is 
that -- in the end -- you and the 
boy desire the same thing...106.

Harry emerges, dripping, from the P ensieve and stares at 
his REFLECTION in the window opp osite, watching as the 
liquid runs like tears from his face, then evaporates.  
Gently, he touches the center of  his chest.

INT. MARBLE STAIR CASE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 328 328
The castle is eer ily quiet as Harry walks, the PORTRAITS 
he passes EMPT Y.  As he re aches the end of  the corridor, 
he turns and stop s.  In the SHADOWS  of an ALCOVE, 
Hermione murmurs to Ron, their faces close.  For a long 
moment, Harry simply watches them.  Then,  as if sensing 
his presence, Hermione turns.  Instantly, sh e runs to 
him.  Ron follows.
HERMIONE
Where’ve you been?
RON
We thought you’d  gone to the 
forest, we thought you might be --
HARRY
I’m going there now.
RON
Are you mad!  No!
HARRY
It’s... meant to be.
RON
Rubbish!  You can ’t just give 
yourself up to him --
Hermione squeezes  Ron’s arm, silencing him.
HERMIONE
What is it, Harry?  What is it you 
know?
Ron studies her face, then lo oks back to Harry.
HARRY
There’s a r eason I can... hear 
them -- the Horcruxes.107.
(CONTINUED)Hermione begins to  shake her hea d, not wanting to 
believe.  Harry s imply nods, touches t he center of his 
chest.
HARRY
I think I’ve k nown for awhile.
(studying her)
I think you’ve known too.
Hermione stands still, miserable.
HERMIONE
I’ll go with you.   I’ll --
She falters ho pelessly as a s ingle tear trac es her cheek. 
Harry reaches out, wipes it away.
HARRY
Kill the snake.  Kill the snake 
and then it’s  just him.  Then it 
will be over.
He turns then, leaving them.  Ron and Hermione stand 
silently, watching e very step he takes until he reaches 
the end... and  is gone.
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NI GHT (MOMENTS LATER) 329 329
As Harry descends, Neville an d Oliver Wood appear in the 
Entrance Hall far  below, carryin g the body of  a smallish 
boy:  Nigel.
OLIVER WOOD
I’ll take him from here.
Oliver throws Nigel over his shoulder, enter s the Great 
Hall.  Neville watches them go, looking, for a moment, 
very old.  Then, wea rily, he turns, headi ng back outside.
EXT. HOGWARTS - GROUNDS - NIG HT (MOMENTS LATER) 330 330
In the distanc e, SHADOWS coll ect the dead , too occupied 
with their grim t ask to notice Harry.  He st ares straight 
ahead, just walki ng, until a VOI CE tugs his ear:
GINNY
It’s all right .  We’re going to 
get you inside.
Ginny crouches ov er the tiny Ravenclaw  girl, who is 
CRYING.108.
CONTINUED:328 328
(CONTINUED)YOUNG GIRL
I kept calling.  No one came.
GINNY
Don’t worry.  I w on’t leave you.  
I promise.
Ginny strokes the sobbing girl’s ha ir, her own face 
haunted by sorrow.  Harry studies her,  moved, then 
continues on.  A moment later , Ginny turn s, looks to the 
place where he wa s standing... but finds only darkness.
EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - NIGHT 331 331
Harry reaches the  Forest’s edge.  W ithin, furth er on, he 
can see Dement ors drifting within the tre es.  Harry 
starts to enter, the n pauses, re aches into his pocket and 
removes the Snitc h.  Eyes the wo rds etched upon  it:  “I 
open at the close.”
Harry frowns, then closes his eyes, brings the metal orb 
to his lips.  His  fingers tremble, then lowers his hand, 
watching as th e metal shell FALLS A WAY to re veal... the 
RESURRECTION STON E.  A JAGGED CRACK runs down its center, 
along the line re presenting the Elder Wand.  Th e TRIANGLE 
and CIRCLE, representing the Cloak and Stone , are faintly 
visible.  Harry s tares at it, th en closes his eyes and 
begins to roll the Stone over in his hand.
HARRY
(murmuring)
Once.  Twic e.  Thrice...
Harry stands for a moment and then,  slowly, opens his 
eyes.  Reacts.  FOUR PEOPLE stand within the Forest:  
JAMES POTTER, SIR IUS BLACK, REMU S LUPIN and LIL Y POTTER.  
Lily eyes him loving ly and beckons him forth.  As if in a 
dream, Harry d rifts through t he trees, stops  before her.
LILY POTTER
You’ve been so brave, sweetheart.
HARRY
Why are you here?   All of you?
LILY POTTER
We never left, dear.
HARRY
Does it hurt?  Dying?
SIRIUS BLACK
Quicker than f alling asleep.109.

(CONTINUED)LUPIN
And he will want it to be quick.
JAMES POTTER
You’re near ly there, son.
HARRY
I’m sorry.  I did n’t want any of 
you to die for me.  And Remus, 
your son...
LUPIN
Others will te ll him what his 
mother and father  died for.  
Someday he’ll understand...
A CHILL BREEZE shake s the trees.  H arry looks ahead.
HARRY
You’ll stay with me?
JAMES POTTER
Until the end.
HARRY
He won’t be able to see you?
Sirius shakes his head, gestures to Ha rry’s heart.
SIRIUS BLACK
No.  We’re her e, you see.
Harry turns to his mother.
HARRY
Stay close to me.
LILY POTTER
Always...
Harry glances back, toward th e Forest’s E dge, takes a 
last look at the cas tle in the distanc e, then sets off.  
Dozens of DEMENTO RS drift amongst the smoking t rees, but 
his guides ins ulate him, and they merely pee l away.  
Harry walks on, his legs driving  him, until LIGHT 
splinters the trees ahead, and a CL EARING comes INTO 
VIEW.
EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEAR ING - NIGHT 332 332
A FIRE burns, its light flickeri ng over the throng of 
DEATH EATERS p resent.  Lucius and NARCISSA MALFOY, weary 
with fear, sit ap art.  BELLATRIX paces in an d out of the 
shadows, MUTTE RING madly.  110.
CONTINUED:331 331
(CONTINUED)And then there is  Voldemort, who  stands with  his head 
bowed, his ske letal hands folded  over the El der Wand.  
Nagini lays in  a heavy coil at his feet.
Yaxley enters the clearing.
YAXLEY
No sign of him , my Lord.
Voldemort nods, unmoving.
VOLDEMORT
I thought he would come.  I was, 
it seems...  mistaken.
HARRY
You weren’t.
All eyes shift to Harry, standing at t he clearing’s edge.  
He lets the Resur rection Stone tumb le from his fingers 
and James, Sirius , Lupin and, lastly, Lily -- all vanish.  
Harry steps in to the firelight.
HAGRID
HARRY!  NO!  W HAT’RE YEH DOIN’ 
‘ERE!
HAGRID is trussed  to a tree.  Th e branches shake 
violently as he trie s to break free.
YAXLEY
Quiet!
He flicks his wand and Hagrid  slumps, goes silent.  A 
CACKLING LAUGH rises on the air and Harry turns, sees 
Bellatrix glancin g eagerly from Harry to Voldemort.
Voldemort takes a step forward and the  flickeri ng flames 
wash over his pale s kin.  He tilts his he ad to the side.  
A smile curls on his mouth.
VOLDEMORT
Harry Potter.  The Boy Who  Lived.  
Come to die.
Nagini HISSES behind her p rotective guard  of Death 
Eaters.  Harry’s gaz e shifts to her wh en Voldemort  raises 
his wand.  Scarlet f lickers in his eyes.  Then a BOLT of 
GREEN LIGHT shatters the nigh t and all is...
INT. KING’S CROSS - DAY 333 333
Gone.111.
CONTINUED:332 332
(CONTINUED)All but a B RIGHT WHITE MIST.
Harry lies face down.  For a long m oment.  Finally, he 
stirs, sits up.  Touches his fac e.  His glasses  are gone.  
He peers into the mist.  N othing.  But somewhere, out 
there, in the mist, is a SOFT THUMPING.
He stands.  Pe ers up.  A DOMED G LASS ROOF hovers -- 
familiar.  The TH UMPING persists.  Unnerving.  Harry 
squints into the mist.
Moving, the TH UMPING growing LOUDER.  Up ahe ad, a SMALL 
MASS quivers.  Ha rry slows... re coils.  A thing  -- like a 
small naked child -- lies SHUDDERING on  the ground, its 
skin raw and r ough.  Harry leans close...
DUMBLEDORE
You cannot help.
Harry spins, f inds Dumbledore standing withi n the mist.  
At the sight of Harry, Dumbledor e beams and spreads his 
arms wide.  His h and is whole, no  longer damaged.
DUMBLEDORE
Harry.  You wonde rful boy.  You 
brave, brave man.   Let us walk.
NEW ANGLE - HARRY  AND DUMBLEDORE
Walking.
HARRY
Sir, this, is this... I mean, 
forgive me, but you are dead, 
aren’t you, sir?
DUMBLEDORE
Oh, yes.
HARRY
Then... I’m dead too?
DUMBLEDORE
Ah.  That is t he question, isn’t 
it?  On the wh ole I think not.
HARRY
Not?
DUMBLEDORE
Not.112.
CONTINUED:333 333
(CONTINUED)HARRY
But I didn’t defe nd myself.  I let 
him kill me.
DUMBLEDORE
And that will, I think, have made 
all the dif ference.  I suspect you 
now realize that you and Voldemort 
have been connect ed by something 
other than fate s ince that night 
in Godric’s Hollo w all those years 
ago, Harry.
HARRY
It’s true, isn’t it, sir?  A bit 
of him lives in me, doesn’t it?
DUMBLEDORE
Did.  It was just destroyed only 
moments ago by none other than 
Voldemort himself.
Harry plays his fingers ov er his sternum.
DUMBLEDORE
You were the seventh Horcrux, 
Harry; the Hor crux he never meant 
to make.
HARRY
And you knew this?  That’s why you 
were certain I wouldn’t die?
DUMBLEDORE
Certain?  No.  Li ttle is certain 
in this world,  Harry.  Call it an 
educated guess.
Dumbledore smiles.  Harry ponders t his, then, d eep in the 
mist, the THUM PING returns.
HARRY
Professor, is that -- ?
DUMBLEDORE
Something beyond either of our 
help.
Harry ponders his  surroundings.
HARRY
Exactly where are  we, sir?113.
CONTINUED: (2)333 333
(CONTINUED)DUMBLEDORE
I was going to ask you that.  
Where would you say that we are?
HARRY
It looks like Kin g’s Cross station 
-- only a lot cleaner.  And 
without the  trains.
DUMBLEDORE
King’s Cross!  Is  that right?  
Well, this is, as  they say, your 
party.
Harry looks perpl exed by this, b ut Dumbledor e only 
smiles.
HARRY
Sir, why didn’t y ou just tell me 
about the D eathly Hallows?
DUMBLEDORE
You will have to forgive me, 
Harry.  You see.. . I didn’t trust 
you.
Harry stares at him.  F or the first ti me, Dumbledore 
looks troubled.
DUMBLEDORE
I feared that you would make the 
same mistake I ma de, that you 
would be in toxicated by the power 
the Hallows promise their 
possessor.  But I crave your 
pardon, Harry.  It’s  clear to me 
now, as it should have been all 
along, that you are the better 
man.
HARRY
Sir --
DUMBLEDORE
You are the wo rthy possessor of 
the Hallows, Harry, not me .  I was 
fit to own the El der Wand, because 
I took it not for  gain, but to 
save others from it.   But I took 
the Stone because  I longed to 
recall someone wh o has long been 
at peace and f or that I paid with 
my life.114.
CONTINUED: (3)333 333
(CONTINUED)HARRY
You wanted to see  Ariana again, 
didn’t you, sir?
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.
Harry ponders thi s, then frowns.
HARRY
I used the Sto ne as well, sir, 
only a little whi le ago when I 
entered the Fo rest.  I saw  my mum 
and dad, and S irius and Lupin...
DUMBLEDORE
True.  But ask yourself this:  
were you calling them?  Or were 
they calling you?
Harry studies Dum bledore, whose expres sion remains 
serene.
DUMBLEDORE
(looking him in the 
eye)
You are the true master of death, 
Harry, because th e true master 
does not seek to run away from 
death.  He accepts that he must 
die, and understa nds that there 
are far, far w orse things in the 
living world.
For a moment, they s tand in silence.
HARRY
I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?
DUMBLEDORE
That is up to you.
HARRY
I’ve got a choice?
DUMBLEDORE
Oh yes.  We are in King’s Cross, 
you say?  I think , should you so 
decide, you would  be able to, 
let’s say, boa rd a train.
HARRY
And where would it take me?115.
CONTINUED: (4)333 333
(CONTINUED)DUMBLEDORE
On.
Harry nods.
HARRY
Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.
DUMBLEDORE
True.
HARRY
And the snake lives.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.
HARRY
And I’ve nothing to kill it with.
DUMBLEDORE
‘Help will always be given at 
Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’
Harry glanc es at him.
DUMBLEDORE
I have always prized  my ability to 
turn a phrase -- wor ds are, in my 
not so humble opinion, our most 
inexhaustible source  of magic, 
capable both of i nflicting injury 
and remedying it.  But I would -- 
in this case -- a mend my original 
statement to this:
(leaning close)
Help will alwa ys be given at 
Hogwarts to th ose who most deserve 
it...
(leaning back)
Assuming circumst ances in the main 
are favorable to suc h an outcome, 
of course.
HARRY
With all due resp ect, sir, I think 
what we need here  is a miracle.
DUMBLEDORE
I’ve never put much stock in 
miracles, H arry.  On the other 
hand, I can attes t wholly to the 
extensive a dvantages of  a related 
phenomenon.116.
CONTINUED: (5)333 333
(CONTINUED)HARRY
Which would  be, sir?
DUMBLEDORE
Luck.
Harry studies Dum bledore’s face, then peers back i nto the 
mist again.  T he THUMPING continues , more faintly.
DUMBLEDORE
Do not pity the dead, Harr y.  Pity 
the living and, a bove all, those 
who live without love.
HARRY
Sir, my mother’s Pat ronus.  It was 
a doe, wasn’t it?   Just like 
Professor Snape’s.   Curious, don’t 
you think?
DUMBLEDORE
Actually, if I think about it... 
it doesn’t seem curious at all.
(a smile)
I’ll be going now, Harry.
HARRY
Professor.
As Dumbledore sto ps, Harry gestures vaguely.
HARRY
Is this real?  Or  has this been 
happening i nside my head?
DUMBLEDORE
Of course it is  happening inside 
your head, Harry.  But why should 
that mean that it  is not real?
Dumbledore beams as the mist thickens around him, then 
swallows him altogether...
NARCISSA (O.S.)
(in a whisper)
Is he alive...?
EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEAR ING - NIGHT 334 334
Harry lies facedown, glasses askew.   He OPENS his eyes a 
millimeter, finds  Narcissa’s fac e swimming in  the dawn’s 
muted light, e yeing him with a strange in tensity:  the 
question, he r ealizes, was po sed to him.117.

(CONTINUED)BELLATRIX
My lord, let me  help you --
VOLDEMORT
I do not requi re assistance.
Across the cle aring, Voldemort rises shakily, Bellatrix 
at his elbow.  The Death Eaters watch, stirring 
uncertainly.  Voldem ort glances toward Narcissa, toward 
Harry.  Bellatrix detects the wary glint in his eyes.
BELLATRIX
The boy.  Is he dead?
Harry’s eyes shif t, meet Narcissa’ s once again.  
Something in her exp ression... He closes his eyes.  She 
places her finger s over his heart, WHISPERS:
NARCISSA
Is he al ive?  Draco?
Harry hesitates and then... nods  -- so subtl y it’s barely 
perceptible.  Nar cissa withdraws he r hand, turns to where 
Bellatrix stan ds alongside Voldemort.  Nods.   The Death 
Eaters CHEER.  Ha grid HOWLS in misery.  The news seems to 
rejuvenate Voldem ort.  A fierce gli nt returns to his 
eyes.  His sta ture grows.  He eyes the Elder  Wand... and 
smiles.
EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 335 335
Neville, battl e-scared and we ary, perches atop a fallen 
statue in the chill morning air.  R eaching into his 
pocket, he removes h is WAND, holds it to the  light... and 
watches the TIP drop like the  head of a d rowsy child.  
BROKEN.  He to sses it away.
NEW ANGLE - NE VILLE - NIGHT
Neville kicks through the rubble.  One could reconstruct 
the history of Ho gwarts from the  detritus be fore him:  
spell books, trop hies, potion boxes.  But  Neville’s 
expression remains s toic, unsentimental.  He’s seen too 
much in the last 12 hours.
CLOSE ON THE PEAK OF A HAT
Neville crouches dow n, studies it.  Reaching out, he 
wiggles it free, sla ps it against his thigh to chase the 
dust.
The Sorting Hat.118.
CONTINUED:334 334
(CONTINUED)He ponders it, regarding its ragged surface, singed and 
torn, then pops it on his head, a beat en jester.  Again, 
his face remai ns blank.  He squints , peering vaguely into 
the distance.  As he gaze fal ls on the bridg e, he stops.  
An odd procession approaches.
EXT. VIADUCT - CONTI NUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 336 336
Hagrid lurches forward awkwardly, CLUTCHING a B ODY in his 
arms, ropes extending in three dire ctions from his neck 
as a trio of Death Eaters -- one in front, t wo behind -- 
jerk him along li ke a tethered beas t.  From Hagrid, 
Neville’s gaze drift s to Bellatrix and Narcissa and then 
to Voldemort h imself -- dark, fierce -- before settling 
on the most un nerving sight:  a giant wendin g snake.
EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS A CTION - NIGHT 337 337
Suddenly a WHI SPER fills N eville’s ears.
SORTING HAT
Don’t despair, Longbottom.  I put 
you in Gryffin dor for good 
reason...
The Hat COUGHS then, raining dus t over Neville’s brow and 
he whips it off, studies it warily.
GINNY (O.S.)
Who’s that?
Neville turns, sees that Ginn y has come o ut onto the 
broken steps a nd is staring at the procession.
GINNY
... Hagrid’s carrying?
Neville just star es, mute.  H er eyes shift t hen, to him, 
and he sees they are glistening faintly.  Her voice, when 
she speaks, nearl y gets lost in the  morning breeze.
GINNY
Neville, who is that?
Before he can ans wer, others begin to spill out of the 
castle.  Luna and  Seamus.  Cho.  Arthur Weasley .  Ron and 
Hermione emerge a nd, seeing the pro cession... know.  
Hermione draws a sharp breath and s omething about it -- 
the unadulterated  sense of lo ss contained wi thin it -- 
causes those arou nd her to look and know as well.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
What’s going on here, Neville?119.
CONTINUED:335 335
(CONTINUED)Neville starts to  speak but falters and then, simply 
because he can’t bear to look at Ginny ’s face and the 
faces of the o thers looking to h im for something, 
anything, he turns his gaze to the Hat  dangling in his 
hand.  And as he doe s, something GL INTS within.  As he

VOLDEMORT
Behold, Nagini.  Our work is done.
EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS A CTION - DAWN 339 339
Ron, Hermione, Gi nny and the oth ers stand silently as the

to Hagrid and what lays in  his arms.
GINNY
No... NO!
Ginny’s primal cry echoes over t he grounds as she rushes 
towards Voldemort, but Arthur st eps between and  wraps his 
daughter in hi s arms, letting her s truggle briefly before 
pulling her tighter, closer, safer.
VOLDEMORT
SILENCE!
Voldemort poin ts his wand to the sky with a CRACK.
VOLDEMORT
Stupid girl.  You cry for that?
Voldemort gestures to  the body lying s till in Hagrid’s 
arms.
VOLDEMORT
(addressing all)
Tell me.  These l ast few hours --

While your hands ran  dark with the

VOLDEMORT
So do no t cry for that.  He’s not

Draco falters briefly, stung, then joins his mother.  She

As Voldemort’s wand FIRES, Neville parries and the curse 
REBOUNDS, taking out the QUARTET of DEATH EATERS flanking 
Bellatrix -- only she is quick e nough to deflect the

It works.
VOLDEMORT

Voldemort, his cl oak swirling li ke water, the great snake

Harry flinches as SHARDS of MARBLE rai n down upon him.  
Wheeling, he fires back.
Voldemort parries Harry’s spells wi th frightening ease, 
mounting the step s and firing ag ain and again.
Eyes darting f rantically, Harry blocks the s pells with a

ANGRY.
VOLDEMORT
Leave her!
Voldemort’s eyes glitte r with RAGE, as if he hi mself had 
been struck by the spell.  Ha rry FIRES again, purposely 
aiming for the snake this time.  Voldemort counters with 
palpable FURY, spells CAROMING MADLY up and down the 
staircase.  Ha rry shields his eyes briefly, then looks 
down and sees...
... a CLOUD OF SMOKE ha nging over the stairs from 
Voldemort’s spells, but  Voldemort himself  is... gone.  
Harry glances about frantically,  then WHOOSH!  The hairs 
on the back of  Harry’s neck rise.  He turns.
Voldemort materia lizes at the top of the stairs, fires a 
RIBBON of FIRE at  him.  Harry count ers it, but it is so 
powerful he can’t deflect it.  He s tands, connected to 
Voldemort by the rip pling ribbon of  fire.  He stumbles

hears a HEAVY ROL LING SOUND, lik e meat slapp ing a marble 
table and look s over his s houlder, downwards.
Nagini is undulat ing upward, over t he steps, toward 
Harry.  As the snake  HISSES an oddl y SIMILAR SOUND

Then, summoning e very bit of strength he’s got, Harry...
... breaks the spell, staggering away, as the ribbon of 
light shoots u pward and the ceiling above  gives way, 
raining debris onto Nagini.
VOLDEMORT
I said LEAVE HER!
Harry peers down at the wreckage be low, then watches 
Nagini slither fr ee, her thick b raids oozing with 
lacerations, but otherwise unharmed .  WOOSH!  Harry turns 
and Voldemort VANISHES again,  only to...
... reappear s econds later on  Harry’s blind side.  Harry 
wheels and, in a sweeping motion, s ends a CLUSTER of 
DEBRIS hurling at Voldemort.
Instantly, Voldemort  reaches out his h and and t he debris

reaches his hand,  it appears to vanish altogeth er.  Then 
he turns his palm upward.
SAND runs between  his fingers to the floor.
Harry stands w atching, stunned.
His eyes meet Vol demort’s.  Voldemo rt’s eyes narrow

McGonagall steps into the aisle, gives him a hug, lightly 
touches his face,  then turns away, eyes glistening.
Aberforth and Oli ver Wood sit ar ound goblets of something 
strong.  Aberfort h gives him a stoic nod.136.

Cho looks up f rom a group of Ravenc laws, smiles  faintly.
Neville sits wear ily, the Sword of Gryffindor still 
clutched limply in h is hand.  Luna sits d own beside him.  
Close.  Smiles.
And then Harry looks up and sees Hagrid fill ing the 
aisle.  Tears in his eyes.  He steps forward, w raps Harry 
in his massive arms.  Harry WINCES, then Hagrid releases 
him, cuffs him on the arm and hobbl es away, blowing his 
nose in a GIANT HANDKERCHIEF.  Harry watches him go, then 
turns, sees:Hermione and Ron.  Standing by the doorway.  Watching 
him.
EXT. VIADUCT - DAY (LATER) 366 366
The trio walk tog ether, then stop, loo k back at the 
battered castle in the distance.
RON
Not exactly le aving the place 
better than we found it, are we?
HERMIONE
Can’t make an omelette without 
breaking a few eggs.
Ron gives her a screwy look.  She shakes her head 
wearily, frowns.
HERMIONE
Something my m um used to say.
Harry studies her , absently playing his fing ers over the 
Elder Wand.  She looks over, nods to it.
HERMIONE
Why didn’t it wor k for him?  The 
Elder wand.
HARRY
Because it answers to another.
Ron and Hermio ne study him.137.
CONTINUED:365 365
(CONTINUED)HARRY
When he killed Snape , he thought 
the wand would be come his.  But 
the thing is... it  never belonged 
to Snape.
Harry turns the w and in the light, eyeing its brutish 
surface as he speaks.
HARRY
It was Drac o who disarmed 
Dumbledore that n ight on the 
Astronomy T ower.  From that moment 
on, the wand answ ered to him.  
Until the other night...
(looking up)
... when I disarmed Draco.
RON
But that means...
Harry nods.
HARRY
It answers to me.
Hermione stares at  Harry.  Ron s tares at the wand.
RON
What do you recko n we should do 
with it?
HERMIONE
We?
RON
I’m just saying.  That’s the Elder 
Wand!  It’s th e most powerful 
bloody wand in the world!  With 
that, we could , we could --
Hermione raises her hand and Ron stops, s ees that her 
eyes are fixed on Harry, who is staring at the wand, his 
concentration tot al.  She studies h is face for a long 
moment, and then -- as if coming to un derstand som ething  
-- begins to nod.
As Harry peers  down at his ha nds, Ron and He rmione do as 
well, watching as  he takes the ends of th e wand and...
Snap!... breaks it in two .  Ron stares, stu nned.  Hermione 
smiles.  Harry, h is face a mask, si mply turns and...138.

(CONTINUED)Pitches the piece s over the edge of the v iaduct.  For a 
moment, the trio stand in silence, as if words would 
bring the bridge crashing down.  Final ly, Harry glances 
off at the ruins of the castle, smo ldering in the 
distance.
HARRY
Well, it wasn’t boring, was it?
Ron turns, ready wit h a reply, but whatever words were 
there -- brief ly -- are gone bef ore he can utter them.
They all stare into the dista nce, giving the mselves over 
to the silence.  Then -- tentativel y, tenderly -- fingers 
reach out -- Hermion e’s -- and brush Ron and Harry’s.  
They look over.  See  that her eyes are  closed, as if she 
were committing the moment to me mory.  They glance 
briefly at one anoth er and then -- tentat ively, tenderly  
-- interlace t heir own finger s with Hermi one’s, looking 
off and -- like her -- closing their eyes.
Gradually, the BI RDSONGS lilting  in the B REEZE give way 
to CAR HORNS...
EXT. KING’S CROSS - MORNING (19 YEARS LATER) 367 367
Two PARENTS, push ing TROLLEYS, shep herd their THREE 
CHILDREN toward t he great sooty station.
EXT. PLATFORM - MORNING (MOME NTS LATER) 368 368
Commuters stare curiously as the family weaves its way to 
a BARRIER between  platforms nine and t en.  As they come 
to a halt, the parents’ faces come clear:  H arry, now 36 
years old, and Gi nny, now 35.  B eside them are their 
children:  JAMES (12), ALBUS (11) a nd LILY -- the 
youngest.
James, mischief in  his eyes, looks bac k at his brother 
just before he runs through the barrier.
And... VANISHES.Albus grips the h andle of his trolley nervously, finding 
it hard to follow.  Harry appears b ehind him, smiles 
tenderly, sees  his son’s nervousness.
OLDER HARRY
Together?
Albus nods and, s ide by side, they run the t rolley at the 
barrier and...139.

... emerge onto a new platform wher e a SCARLET STEAM 
ENGINE pours WHITE S MOKE into the air.   Seconds later, 
Ginny and Lily ap pear.  Albus peers  about anxiously.
There is a riot of  activity, as wizarding paren ts see off 
their children and t runks are loade d.  There ar e lots of 
first years li ke ALBUS, looking equally nervous and being 
given a final sen d-off.  ALBUS look s at it all with 
trepidation.  LILY races off cha sing a paper  bird that 
flies through the crowd.
Up ahead ALBUS se es FOUR PEOPLE through the ste am:  Ron, 
Hermione and thei r two children, RO SE (11) and little 
HUGO, as ROSE’S l uggage is packed o nto the train -- 
gentle goodbyes.  RON waves over to HARRY.
OLDER HERMIONE gives her daughter R OSE one last hug.
OLDER HERMIONE
Don’t forget to give Professor 
Longbottom our best.
ALBUS looks at  the train, the n back to HA RRY.  Then he 
disappears...
HARRY and GINNY share a knowing loo k, and then as GINNY 
takes charge of t he trolley, HARRY return s to ALBUS, who 
is now kneeling down, struggling with his shoelace.
HARRY leans down and joins him.
ALBUS
Will there really be thestrals 
pulling the carriages?
Harry eyes his  son warmly.
OLDER HARRY
There’s nothing scary about 
thestrals.  They’re gentle things.  
Anyway, you won’t be  going up to 
school in the car riages.  You’ll 
be going in th e boats, remember?
Albus nods, looks down.
ALBUS
Dad?
OLDER HARRY
Yes?140.
(CONTINUED)ALBUS
What if I’m put in Slytherin?
Harry studies his son long and hard.  Leans close.
OLDER HARRY
Albus Severus Pot ter.  You were 
named after two Headmasters of 
Hogwarts.  One of them was a 
Slytherin.  And he was probably 
the bravest ma n I ever knew.
Albus nods, th inks for a mome nt... then frowns.
ALBUS
But just say I am -- 
OLDER HARRY
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard.  But 
listen, if it mea ns so much to 
you, you can c hoose Gryffindor.  
The Sorting Hat t akes your choice 
into account.
ALBUS
Really?
OLDER HARRY
Really.
The TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS and Albus’  eyes go wide.
OLDER HARRY
Ready?
ALBUS
Ready.
They stand, consi der each other for a moment, then HARRY 
leans over and gives his s on a big hug.
ALBUS settles int o his seat o pposite ROSE, looks around 
him, a chocolate fro g jumps up the window, a Weasley 
Firework caroms d own the train corridor beyond.   This is 
going to be quite  a journey.  ALBUS smiles and looks out 
to his Dad.
Raises a hand to wave.And the train jol ts to a start.
HARRY, GINNY, RON , and HERMIONE wat ch with affection.141.

(CONTINUED)LILY looks like a ll she wants to  do is to  jump on the 
train and leav e with it.
The train heads off.
We SLOWLY MOVE INTO HARRY as he waves,  pride, and more 
than a little nos talgia clear in his face, as the train 
slips away.
FADE TO BLACK.
