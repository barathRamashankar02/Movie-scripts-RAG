Marta puts her head in her hand.  Looks at her mom, wholooks back at her with protective sympathy.  Marta startslaughing at the absurdity of it, but the laugh turns intocrying.
MARTA

INT. FOYER
Thrombey's eldest daughter Linda opens the door for Marta.
LINDA

Linda is 60ish, well put together, sharp and steely eyed. 
She dresses and speaks with just a little more sharpnessthan any situation she's in requires.
MARTA
Hi Linda.  How are you?
LINDA
Ueuh.  The funeral helped.  I guess. Just seeing him.  I thought youshould have been there.  I was outvoted.
Linda's husband Richard walks in, on the phone.  Same age asLinda, gruff and confident, will put his feet up onanything.

LINDA
Alright I'll go first.  I'm assumingthis will all be wrapped up beforethe memorial tonight.

RICHARD
So.  How you doing kiddo.
INT. LIBRARY
Mystery and horror memorabilia scattered on the shelves.Linda sits opposite three men:  LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT, in his
30s, in a working suit.  Very good at his job. The youngTrooper Wagner stands behind him.
Sitting back behind both of them, almost blending into the
background, is a slight man in a linen suit. Legs and armsfold sharply, like a paper crane. Silent, listening.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
We are just going to reintroduceourselves as a formality, I'mDetective Lieutenant Elliott, andthis is Trooper Wagner.  Now, I'mgoing to record, just makes iteasier.
squints at his phone( )
Alright, we're with Linda Drysdale,nee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey'seldest daughter, in discussing theevents the night of his demise, oneweek ago, November 8th.
TROOPER WAGNER
We're sorry for your loss.5.LINDA

Thank you that means a lot.
Elliott checks his notes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So we understand that night the
family had gathered to celebrate yourfather's eighty fifth birthday.
LINDA
Yes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
How was that?
LINDA
The party?  Pre my dad's death?  Itwas great.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Warmly lit, classic rock playing, food laid out.  Linda and
Richard mingle happily with the rest of the family (whowe'll meet shortly.)
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)

LINDA (V.O.)
Uh.  There was  Fran, thehousekeeper.  Marta, Harlan'scaregiver, good girl, hard worker. Family's from Ecuador.  And Wanetta -Greatnana, Harlan's mom.
At the snack table wearing a dozen coats, a woman who mightbe three hundred years old.  She pounds down chips and diplike a machine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
wow()
His mom?  How old is she?
LINDA (V.O.)
We have no idea.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Okay, Your son Ransom, was he thereas well?6.LINDA (V.O.)
Yes but he left early.
RANSOM DRYSDALE, roguishly handsome in his early 30s,
breezes out the side door, past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom, are you leaving?
INT. LIBRARY
The strange man in the linen suit taps a piano key, as if
reminding to ask him something.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Right, did all three of you show upat around the same time?
LINDA
N...o, Richard came early to help thecaterers set up.
She raises a questioning finger to ask about the man but
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Okay and you and your husband Richardwork for a real estate firm inBoston?
LINDA

It's my company.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
checks notes( )
Sorry.  Right.
LINDA
I built my business from the groundup.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just like your dad. You two were veryclose?
LINDA
We had our own secret way ofcommunicating.  You had to find thatwith dad.  You had to find a game toplay with him.  And if you did that,and played by his rules...7.CUT TO:  Richard in the chair Linda was in, giving his
statement.
RICHARD
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I don't know, do they?
RICHARD
Very much not, don't know why I saidthat.  But Linda does.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Harlan Thrombey, surrounded by his family, Richard and Linda
flanking him, a birthday cake with candles.  All smiles.
RICHARD (V.O.)
Harlan started with a rusty Smith-Corona, built himself into one of thebestselling mystery writers of alltime. 
INT. LIBRARY
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Seems like all his kids are self madeoverachievers.
Richard makes a "...sure" face.
RICHARD
Sure.
CUT TO:
WALT THROMBEY now sits in the questioning chair.  Late 40s,
softly obsequious in a sweater and loafers.  His leg is in acast.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
For the record, I'm speaking to WaltThrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngestson. 
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (cont'd)

BIG fan.  Big.
TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
His plots, like something like "AThousand Knives," with the - I don'twant to spoil it but - the cow andthe shotgun, like where do you comeup with that?
WALT
Dad said the plots just popped intohis head fully formed, that was theeasy part for him -
TAP from the linen suit man's finger.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You live in town, right? You guysprobably arrived at around the sametime?
Walt looks at Linen suit, thrown.
WALT
Uh.  We all got here around 8.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt laughing and mingling with his nervous wife DONNA.
WALT (V.O.)
My wife Donna, she's my rock.
Richard backs up into Donna, who YELPS in fear and throws
her martini in the air.  Richard jumps, but Walt doesn'teven register it.
RICHARD
Jeeesus!  Donna, you alright?
WALT (V.O.)
And my son Jacob, he's sixteen.  Verypolitically active.9.His angry looking son JACOB, who is always on his phone.
INT. LIBRARY

MEG
He's an alt-right troll dipshit
WALT
Kids today, with the internet,
amazing.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So the night went well?
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The exact same moment we saw with Richard and Linda of
Harlan in front of the birthday cake - but now it's Walt,Donna and Jacob next to Harlan.
WALT (V.O.)
I mean.  We're all gutted but I'mhappy we got that night with him.  Tobe by his side, to think about ourbooks and what we've accomplishedwith them, it's like I can still feelhis hand on my shoulder.
INT. LIBRARY
WALT
Passing the torch.
Cut to:  JONI THROMBEY in the chair.  A striking woman, talland boho chic in chunky jewelry and a flowy dress.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So we are with Joni Thrombey, HarlanThrombey's... daughter in law?
JONI
Mm.  I was married to his son Neil,We had one daughter, Meg, and thenNeil passed on fifteen years ago.10.LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And you remained close to the
Thrombeys.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Joni dances with various family members, free and flowing.
JONI (V.O.)
Oh they're my family.  I feel
simultaneously freed by and supportedby them, that balance of opposites isthe nugget of Flam.
INT. LIBRARY - PRESENT
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Sorry, the Nugget of?
JONI
Flam.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ah!  Yeah Flam, right, your skin carecompany. Sorry.
JONI
I forgive you, yes, it's skin carebut it promotes a total lifestyle. Self sufficiency with anacknowledgment of human need.  That'sFlam, but it's also Harlan.  He gotme and Meg through some tough times.
Meg in the chair.
MEG
Granddad gives my mom a yearlyallowance, and he's never missedwiring a tuition payment to myschools. He's a genuinely selflessman.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
You left his party early?
MEG
To see some friends at Smith.11.INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Meg trots out.  Linda, pissed, to Richard so Joni can hear:
LINDA
you know, Dad's paying for her
crypto-Marxist postdeconstructualfeminist poetry theory whatevermajor, she could have stuck aroundfor the cake.
INT. LIBRARY
JONI
I think Linda was upset.  But Harlanunderstood.
Tap.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Right. You two arrived together tothe party at the same time?
Joni looks at the linen suit man.
JONI
If I could - pause - because I, whois that guy?  And why are we doingall this?  Again?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Just some follow up questions, justbeing thorough, in order to determinethe manner of death.
Cut back to Walt in the chair.
WALT
almost laughing( )
So by "manner of death" you mean ifhe was killed.  If one of us killedhim.  One of his family?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
None of us think that, this is proforma, all of it.
CUT TO:  Richard in the chair.  He doesn't buy it. 
RICHARD
Ok.  So who the fuck is that?12.He points at linen suit.  Elliott takes a breath.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
This is Benoit Blanc.
RICHARD
the hell?( )
Benoit Blanc?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private
investigator of great renown.
Joni in the chair.
JONI
Wait a minute - I read a tweet abouta New Yorker article about you.  Thelast of the gentlemen sleuths?  Yousolved that case with the tennischamp - you're famous!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Mr. Blanc is not with the policedepartment, he is not officiallyinvolved with the case but he hasoffered to consult. I happily obligedand I can vouch for him.
Linda in the chair.
LINDA
Mr.  Blanc, I know who you are, Iread your New Yorker profile.  It wasdelightful.  I just buried my eightyfive year old father who committedsuicide.  Why are you here?
Elliott and Wagner turn back to Blanc, who leans forwardslightly and speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you haveever heard in your life.
BLANC
I am here at the behest of a client.
LINDA
Who?
BLANC
I cannot say, but let me assure youthis:  my presence will beornamental.
(MORE)13.You will find me a respectful, quiet,BLANC(cont'd)
passive observer.  Of the truth.
Elliott and Wagner turn nervously back to Linda.  She
doesn't look thrilled.  Cut to Richard.
RICHARD
Fine.  Are we getting there?
BLANC
Nearly.  Harlan's nurse.  She was atthe party in a professional capacity?
Blanc begins idly playing with a silver dollar.
RICHARD
Marta? 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family is engaged in an animated discussion, Marta
standing on the outskirts.
RICHARD (V.O.)
I guess.  Harlan hired her to bearound, take care of whatever medicalneeds pop up, but really she's likepart of the family.
Richard beckons with his cake, calls Marta into thediscussion, into the circle of the family.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
Good kid, been a good friend toHarlan.  Her family's from Paraguay.Linda really likes her work ethic.
INT. LIBRARY
RICHARD
"Immigrants - we get the job done." From Hamilton.
Wagner gives him a smile to show he got the reference.
TROOPER WAGNER
Oh Hamilton!
RICHARD
I saw it at the public.14.Cut to Linda back in the chair.
BLANC
May I just - and then I'll recede,
but as a self made man myself I haveto express my admiration for howyou've followed in your father'sfootsteps.
LINDA
Thank you.
BLANC
Just marvelous. The whole family too.Joni with her things, Walt with hispublishing empire.
LINDA
Well.
Blanc pauses.  Doesn't push anything.  Just waits a moment.
LINDA(cont'd)
Yes.  I mean.  Walt, yeah.  He's donewell with what dad's given him.Walt - not like it matters but he wassort of adrift, dad gave him the job,but really dad hands him a book twicea year and Walt publishes it, Imean... it's just not the same.
BLANC
But surely Walt runs themerchandising, adaptations, film andtelevision rights...
Linda squints, narrowing her eyes on Blanc.  Softly:
LINDA
Are you baiting me, Detective?  Youknow he doesn't, and you think I'mdumb enough to be baited into talkingfamily business, into shit talking mybrother in front of a policedetective and a state trooper -
Richard in the chair.
RICHARD
Walt doesn't run shit!  There are nofilm or TV rights, Harlan's neverallowed any adaptations of his books. Hates the idea. 15.BLANC
No!
RICHARD
Oh yeah!  Drives Walt nuts, cause
that's where the real money's at. When he gets a little Irish couragein him he'll get into it with Harlan.
BLANC
Did he get "into it" at the party?
RICHARD
Oh my god.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt with a drink in his hand has cornered Harlan.  Richard
watches across the room as Walt goes from arguing topleading.
RICHARD (V.O.)
He wouldn't leave him alone, poorguy.  Harlan had to give him thehook.
Harlan has had enough, he takes Walt's arm and leads himinto the drawing room for a private talk.
RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
I didn't hear what he said but hemust have really handed him hislunch, Walt was like a wounded puppythe rest of the night.
INT. LIBRARY
Walt in the chair, indignant.
WALT
What?  Richard said what? 
Jesus.  No, we didn't get"into it." BLANC
I'm just trying to get anaccurate impression - Harlantook you aside at the party,when you returned you werechastened, what did Harlansay to you?
Walt starts to open his mouth, hesitates.  Off hisfrightened face we FLASH BACK:16.INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Walt, drunk, Harlan guiding him firmly into the shadows.
WALT
The Netflix guys, their
business affairs guy sentover something, hard numbersthis time, and I think -this is a window, it's notgoing to last and you shouldjust look at these numbersHARLAN
Walt. 
Walt.
WALT
Dad you put me in charge of our books
let me be in charge, let me do this! Please.
HARLAN
They're not our books, son.  They'remy books.  And this is not how Iwanted to have this conversation but,you're right, it's unfair of me tokeep you tethered to something thatisn't yours to control.
WALT
What?
HARLAN
I've done you a grave disservice allthese years, I've kept you frombuilding something of your own,that's yours.  You're not going torun the publishing house anymore. Youare free of it.
WALT
Dad.  Are you firing me?
HARLAN
We'll talk about details tomorrow. But my mind's made up. Good boy.
Harlan pats his face, then leaves him shell shocked.
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Walt's hesitating face.  The briefest of moments has
passed.  Walt lies:17.WALT
We talked, we had a business
discussion, about e-books, Jesus, itwas nothing.  You want to talk aboutan argument, hell Ransom had anargument with him.
BLANC
Ransom, Richard and Linda's son?
WALT
Look we love Ransom, he is a goodkid, we love him. 
BLANC
...but
WALT
But he's always been the black sheepof the family, and I'm not, I, I keepstuff like this in the family, butwith Ransom, he's never had a job. But dad for some unknown reason hasalways supported him, they've gotthis love hate bond.  They fight. But that night, god.  They had a blowout.
BLANC
About what?
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
The family having a conversation, everyone but Harlan, Jacob
and Ransom.  It grinds to a halt as through the door toHarlan's study indistinct shouting booms.
WALT (V.O.)
We couldn't make it out, but it washuge.  And it was strange they wentin another room to do it - theyusually love stoking up drama infront of the whole family.
Ransom bursts out of the doors and storms out of the party,past Greatnana.
GREATNANA
Ransom are you leaving?18.INT. LIBRARY
Richard in the chair.
BLANC
Speaking of getting into it, you were
at the house early to help thecaterer set up.  Did you conversewith Harlan at that time?
RICHARD
He was there, we must have spoke.
BLANC
In his study?
RICHARD
I don't think so.
BLANC
You see, I spoke with the catererthis morning.  She didn't see youhelping her staff, but she did hearHarlan in a screaming match withsomeone that afternoon. In his study.
RICHARD
I don't, a screaming match?  No. Joni was here too, she was early,maybe it was her, ask her.
BLANC
These were two male voices.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY OF PARTY
A CATERER walks through with a platter.  Pauses, hears
shouting through the wall.
BLANC (V.O.)
Harlan shouted the phrase
HARLAN (O.S.)
...you tell her or I will!
INT. LIBRARY
BLANC
You tell her.  Or I will.  Bellsringing?19.For a just a split second, Richard considers what he is
going to say.  In the second, we FLASH BACK:
INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan showing Richard photos on a laptop.  Long lens
photos,  of Richard kissing a woman who is not Linda. Richard glares at it, Harlan turns an old baseball over inhis hands.
RICHARD
That's none of your business, Harlan. Stay out of my marriage.
Harlan holds up a sealed small envelope with floweryembroidery, "L" written on the front.
HARLAN
I know my daughter. She'd want toknow.  I've put it all in this letterto her, tomorrow she gets it.
RICHARD
I'm warning you once, don'tdo this like hell -HARLAN
She deserves to know, you'regoing to tell her!
Harlan slams the baseball down on the desk.
HARLAN(cont'd)
You tell her or I will!
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Richard.  He grins, snaps his fingers.
RICHARD
Yes.  I know - yes, ha.  So.  Harlan
decided to finally put his mom in anursing home.  Which Linda alwaysopposed.  And I was going to waittill we were back home in Boston totell her, so there wouldn't be awhole scene, but Harlan wanted me totell her then. That was it. Sorry. Forgot.
Joni in the chair.
JONI
The house?20.BLANC
Early.  Richard said you were there.
JONI
I was.  At the house early.
BLANC
To see Harlan?
JONI
To see Harlan.  Yes.
Joni stops, smelling something in the air.  She's about to
ask about it but -
BLANC
What were you seeing Harlan about?
JONI
It was just a mix up with the paymentfor Meg's tuition.
BLANC
I'm sorry to press, what kind of mixup?
Joni hesitates, we FLASH BACK:
INT. SMALL STUDY - DAY OF PARTY
Harlan at his desk, toying with the same old baseball. This
is a thing he does at his desk. Joni standing, arms crossed.
JONI
The school hasn't got the check yet,I don't know why Alan didn't mail it
HARLAN
Alan didn't mail it because he caughta discrepancy.  Alan's office hasbeen wiring tuition directly to theschool, as per your request.  ButPhyllis's office that handles youryearly allowance has been wiring thetuition money directly to you aswell.  As per your request.  You'vebeen double dipping Meg's tuition,stealing from me.  A hundred thousanddollars a year.  For the past fouryears.21.Harlan shows Joni a letter from his business manager, with
transaction receipts attached.
JONI
Harlan.  I don't know how this mix uphappened but
Harlan opens his ledger, hand writes a check.
HARLAN
I'm writing this tuition check, thenthat is the last money you or Megwill get from me. 
JONI
Please you don't understand
HARLAN
I know it'll hurt but it's for thebest.
Joni's speechless, her face frozen.  Harlan puts thebaseball down and detaches the check, holds it out to her.
HARLAN(cont'd)
My mind's made up.
INT. LIBRARY
Back to Joni.  She shakes her head.
JONI
Just a money wiring issue.  With the
office at the school.  So I had toask Harlan to cut a check for thissemester.  No big deal.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Why don't we take a breather.
INT. FOYER - DAY
Joni comes out into the foyer from the library, obviously
rattled.  She pulls it together quick when Linda comes downthe stairs.
LINDA
Joni.  You haven't seen Richard haveyou?22.JONI
No, I was just in with the - no.
INT. SMALL STUDY
LINDA (O.S.)
Richard!
Alone, Richard waits very still for Linda's footsteps to
walk away, then when he knows she's not coming in hefurtively rifles through desk drawers, finding variousridiculous ephemera.  He finds a small locked drawer,jimmies it open with a letter opener.
Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him with
in his flashback.  He rips it open, pulls out the cardinside.
It is blank.Richard almost laughs.  Drops it onto the desk.
RICHARD
Son of a bitch.
He spots Harlan's old baseball.  Grabs it, spitefully chucks
it out the open window.
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
Blanc, Elliott and Wagner stroll long the wide lawn beside
the house.  Blanc ignites a long thin cigar.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Maybe I'm a victim of my ownexpectations.  But when the greatBenoit Blanc knocks on my door, Iexpect it's going to be forsomething...  if not extraordinary,at least interesting.  This is anopen and shut case of suicide.
checks watch( )
And Benny we're at the point where Ineed to know what we're doing here.
Blanc notices the OLD BASEBALL lying in the grass.  He picksit up idly.23.BLANC
The method, throat slit.  Typical of
a suicide?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Dramatic.  But look around.  The guypractically lives in a CLUE board.
INT. FOYER
Marta sits alone, across from a portrait of Harlan.  Muffled
voices out on the patio.  Cigar smoke drifts by outside.
She creeps over to the glass door.  Puts her ear to it.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (O.S.)
You ask me to drag all these good
people back for questioning, go overit all again, I don't get it.  Thisis a pleasant family with the usualquarrels but no possible motives formurder - where are you going?
At that moment, BLANC's face appears right next to Marta'sstaring right at her through the distorted glass.  She yelpsand falls back.
EXT. PATIO
Blanc opens the glass door.  Marta steps back sheepishly,
but with a warm nod Blanc beckons for her to join them.
BLANC
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...
MARTA
...Cabrera
BLANC
Marta Cabrera.
TROOPER WAGNER
Miss Cabrera, you can just waitinside - we'll be with you soon.
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, I been doing a littlepoking, you're hired on a part timebasis as a registered nurse, yes?24.MARTA
Yeah, I don't work for a VNA.  Harlan
hired me directly.
BLANC
You're paid a flat rate for how manyhours a week?
MARTA
I started at 15, but slowly he...needed more help. 
BLANC
Medical help?
MARTA
He needed a friend.
Blanc smiles at the girl, genuinely touched.
BLANC
Does having a kind heart make you agood nurse? 
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc.
BLANC
Yes.  Marta we were just discussingpossible motives in the family.  Isuspect Harlan has told you muchunfiltered truth about each of them,and a little bird has told me, howshall I put this delicately? You havea regurgitive reaction tomistruthin'.
MARTA
Who told you that?
BLANC
Is it true?
MARTA
Yes. It's something that I have hadas a kid. It's a physically thingthat I - I - Just the thought oflying, yeah, it makes me puke.
BLANC
Really? Is Richard having an affair?
Marta is stunned.  She FLASHES BACK TO:25.EXT. PATIO - DAY - FLASHBACK
She reads, Harlan sits at his laptop, heavy with sadness.
HARLAN
Why do men instinctively pull at
loose threads on their parachutes?
MARTA
What?
Harlan spins his laptop towards her - the Richard photos.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Back to our scene.  Marta looks queasy, tries to stall.
MARTA
Heh - Richard? - affair?  Heh.
BLANC
A yes or no will do.
She struggles, her jaw clenched, face working hard, then
attempts -
MARTA
.....no
And immediately VOMITS into a nearby planter. 
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Whoa!TROOPER WAGNER
Oh my god!
They all rush to her, Blanc brings water, awfully concerned.
BLANC
Dear girl I'm sorry.  I assumed youwere speaking figuratively.
Blanc takes the shortest acceptable beat of concern beforeturning to Elliott.
BLANC(cont'd)
Quite something. But I was obviouslyright, Richard is
 having an affair,
his father in law found out andconfronted him.  "You tell her.  Or Iwill."
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Even if it's true... you ok?26.Marta gives a weak thumbs up, recovering
ELLIOTT
Even if that was right, protecting
his marriage is weak sauce as amotive.
BLANC
Well.  And then there is... Joni.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Joni?TROOPER WAGNER
Joni?!
TROOPER WAGNER (cont'd)
Lifestyle guru Joni?  No.  Harlan wassupporting her and her daughter, shehad the opposite of a motive.
Marta tries to quietly slip back into the house
BLANC
And if that support was threatened?Miss Cabrera one moment please
MARTA
I'm just going to go get some Scope
BLANC
Miss Cabrera, was Harlan planning oncutting off Joni's allowance?
Off Marta's "oh god no" face:
INT. STUDY - DAY - FLASHBACK
Harlan looking at the letter from his business manager, with
the transaction receipts.  He sighs heavily.
HARLAN
Oh, Joni.
MARTA
What's up?
He hands her the letter.
EXT. PATIO - DAY
Marta's face works against impending nausea.27.MARTA
I...
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Ok don't answer that if you're going
to puke.  Please.
But Blanc presses.
BLANC
Meg said Harlan pays the schooldirectly, Joni says he sends themoney to her.  Both were true, shewas pocketing the double payment,Harlan found out and cut her offwithout a cent.  Yes?
Marta starts to shake her head no, but her throat convulses. She nods.  Blanc hands her a glass of water.
TROOPER WAGNER
And she bumps him off for theinheritance?  Come. On!  Have youseen her insta?  She's an influencer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
An allowance as a motive, Blanc.  Shehas her business.  More weak sauce.
Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck.
BLANC
Granted.  But she lied.  To me.  Allthree of them did.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Three?
BLANC
Walter.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I see where you are going with this.
BLANC
But there was something else. Harlanhad turned Walter down beforeregarding film rights, but that nightsomething Harlan said shook him.  Welook at the pattern, Harlan wascleaning house.  I wonder...
to Marta( )
did he plan to fire Walter?28.MARTA
honest & relieved( )
Can I wait inside?  I don't feel like
I should be here.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Yes, please just wait inside but stayclose.
She steps back in, grateful.  Blanc to Elliott:
BLANC
You've been very patient my friend,and you are right, none of these weakalibis and domestic squibbles answeryour question: why is Benoit Blanchere?  But now I will tell you why.
beat()
I am here because this morningsomeone dodged one very importantquestion.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Who?
BLANC
Me.  Linda asked who hired me.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
So who hired you?
BLANC
I. Do. Not. Know.  An envelope ofcash showed up at my apartmentyesterday, with the news clipping ofThrombey's death.
TROOPER WAGNER
An envelope?  That worked?
BLANC
An envelope of cash.
Blanc indicates with his fingers - several inches thick.
BLANC(cont'd)
So somebody suspects foul play, butgoes through this ha cha dance ofhiring me, of staying anonymous. Itmakes no damn sense.  Compels methough. 
(MORE)29.beat()BLANC(cont'd)
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.
Elliott hesitates, but Blanc's got him hooked.  He flipsopen his notebook.  Blanc leans back, closes his eyes.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
We know, the party broke up at 11:30.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Marta and Harlan vanish up the stairs towards the third
floor, while Richard and Linda head into the bedroom rightnext to the stairs.  Down the hallway Joni waves, and ducksinto another bedroom.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Marta took Harlan upstairs to givehim his meds, Richard and Linda andJoni went right to bed.  Now we dohave this:  the stairs leading up toHarlan's bedroom and his attic officecreak horribly.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF THE PARTY
Richard sleeps deep, Linda sleeps lightly.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
And Linda is a light sleeper.  So we
know every time someone took thestairs that night.
INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni has decorated the room with colorful silks and candles. 
She is in lotus position on her bed, meditating.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
The first was when Joni heard a ka-THUNK from somewhere above her in thehouse.
Ka-THUNK!  Joni looks up at the ceiling.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni trots down the hall and up the creaky stairs.30.LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
She's concerned about Harlan, she
went up to investigate.  WakingLinda.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
CREAK CREAK CREAK! From outside.  Linda's eyes pop open.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
Joni knocks on the door of Harlan's attic office.  It opens,
and Harlan answers.  In the room behind him we see Marta,her back turned, preparing a hypo needle.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Harlan was in his attic office withMarta.  He explained that they hadjust knocked the GO board over - thatgame with the grid and stones, theyplay it every night, and he was fine,go to bed.  So she does.
The spilled GO board on the floor.  Joni kisses Harlan onthe cheek, goes.  He shuts the door.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Linda has just gotten back to sleep.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Ten minutes later, Linda is woken a
second time, by Marta leaving.
CREAK CREAK CREAK!  Linda wakes, supremely annoyed.
MARTA (O.S.)
Walt!  I'm leaving!
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt and Jacob sit on the porch, Walt with a cigar, Jacob
with his phone.  Marta trots through, saying goodbye.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Walt was smoking a cigar on the porchwith his son.  He saw her leave anddrive off, and noted the time -midnight.31.Walt glances at his watch.  Midnight.
INT. RICHARD AND LINDA'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Linda with a pillow over her head.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Fifteen minutes later, Linda is woken
for the third and final time.  Bysomeone coming down
 the stairs.
CREAK CREAK CREAK! Linda wakes. You've gotta be kidding me.
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF PARTY
Walt, still smoking with Jacob, spots Harlan through the
glazed glass, coming down the stairs in the foyer.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Harlan.  Who came down for midnightsnacks, which Walt tried todiscourage.
WALT
Dad, go to bed!
Through the glazed glass, Harlan goes back up the stairs.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Based on this, the medical examinerdetermined time of death to bebetween 12:15 and 2am.  As Walt wasfinishing his cigar, about 12:30, Megcame home.  She went straight to bed. Walt and Jacob turned in shortlyafter that.
Meg pulls up, trots past Walt and Jacob and inside.
INT. JONI AND MEG'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY
Meg stirs, wakes.  Joni is asleep.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (V.O.)
Sometime later that night,
undetermined but possibly near 3am,Meg woke up because the dogs werebarking outside.  She used thebathroom and went back to bed.32.EXT. PATIO - DAY
Elliott snaps the notebook closed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And that's it.  Everyone's stories
matched, every movement accountedfor.
BLANC
There is no other staircase up toHarlan's room?
Blanc scratches that same spot on the side of his neck.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
No.  Just the creaky one.
Blanc seems intrigued by this.
BLANC
Interesting.
TROOPER WAGNER
So I guess we can rule out Ransom, hewasn't there.  And Marta, Harlan wasalive after she left.  But Meg gothome during the time of death window.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Except it was a suicide.  Harlan hitboth carotids, we saw from the bloodblood splat patterns that they wereuninterrupted.  Meaning, It's almostimpossible for anyone to have beenaround him at the time. He's the onethat cut his own throat. I don't knowwhy we keep going over this.
BLANC
Physical evidence can tell a clearstory with a forked tongue.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What?
BLANC
And as we've seen this morning,everyone can lie.  Well.  Almosteveryone.33.INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Marta in the chair.  She shifts, uncomfortable.Blanc, Elliott and Wagner in their normal places.
BLANC
Ms. Cabrera, we've kept you waiting
all afternoon because I wanted tohear from you last.  I wanted to havethe entire picture of the evening inmy head.  Your piece of it is at itsvery center.  So please, take yourtime.  You took Mr. Thrombey upstairsat 11:30.  And left at midnight. Think very carefully.  And with asmuch detail as possible, tell us whathappened in that half hour.
Marta is very still.  A moment of silence.  Blanc flips hissilver dollar into the air.
She does not say a word, but in that moment while the coin
hangs in the air we FLASH BACK with her to:
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
The night of the party.  A clock on a nightstand: 11:32. 
Off screen we hear Marta leading Harlan up the creakystairs.
MARTA
Up up up up - you got it?HARLAN
I got it.  Up up up I gotit.
Marta enters the room, and behind her we see Harlan keepclimbing up the narrow stairs to his office.
MARTA
Up up nooooo no not tonight, nostraight to bed tonight it is soooolate c'mon.  Harlan.  Harlan!
She grabs a med kit from the bedroom and follows him,exasperated.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Harlan sits, setting up a GO board.  Marta enters.34.MARTA
It's late, I had champagne
no no noHARLAN
It's my birthday, we are -You had one glass - we'renot breaking tradition on mybirthday.
Marta puts two vials and a pill box on the GO board.  Shepulls out two plastic wrapped hypodermics.
MARTA
Take your goddamn medicine and go tobed.
HARLAN
If you're going to put that vile shitin me you will have to earn it.  Onmy birthday.
playing it up( )
Eighty fifth.  So old.  Soo olddd
MARTA
Alright old man.  8x8 game. Youready?
She sits and they start clacking white and black stones onthe board.
HARLAN
Why can't I beat you at thisgame? 
Oh uh huh.MARTA
Because I'm not playing to
beat you, I'm playing tobuild a beautiful pattern.
They play fast, and Marta is obviously winning.
HARLAN
Elder abuse.  I'm calling the AARP.
MARTA
Don't make me get the belt.
HARLAN
It's basically over.  My only hope isthat an earthquake will strike.  Butwhat are the chances -
Harlan starts shaking the table with his knee.  He looksaround, startled.  Marta just stares at him, deadpan.
HARLAN(cont'd)
Get under a door frame!35.He tips the whole table and the GO board and med vials and
syringe and med kit fall to the soft rug.  Things spill outof the kit.  A mess.  Marta just shakes her head.
MARTA
Meds then beds.
HARLAN
Fair.
She retrieves the vials and loads a syringe from one ofthem.  Harlan rolls up his sleeve revealing a pre-insertedcatheter.  He crosses to close the room's only small window.
HARLAN(cont'd)
Ugh, Walt's smoking a cigar on theporch.  Nasty things.
MARTA
How was tonight?
She hooks the syringe up to the catheter and slowly injectshim bit by bit while he talks.
HARLAN
Tonight was... good.
MARTA
Because I know you weren't lookingforward to it.
HARLAN
No. But I did it.  Cut the line onall four of them.  It was not easy. This goddamn fortune. Sometimes Ithink, everything I've given myfamily, I've done, maybe withoutknowing it, maybe, to keep thembeneath me. I should have what...maybe, I don't know.  Encouraged Waltto write his own stories, not just bea caretaker of mine.  Like you said Ishould.  Been a father, not just aprovider, to Joni.  Like you've alsosaid.  I should have been kinder toLinda.  And Ransom.
Harlan takes a curved ornamental dagger from a displaymount, turns it over in his hands.
HARLAN(cont'd)
Jesus there's so much me in that kid.Confident, stupid, I dunno. 
(MORE)36.Protected.  Playing life like a gameHARLAN(cont'd)
without consequence, till you can't
tell the difference between a stageprop and a real knife.
He stabs it into the desk, sharp and real.  Leaves it there.
HARLAN(cont'd)
I don't fear death.  But god I'd liketo fix some of this before I go.Close the book with a flourish. Iguess we'll see.
MARTA
I guess we will.  Hey.  Old man.You've had a long day. Wanna dodrugs.
She loads the second syringe from the second vial.
HARLAN
you mean the good stuff?
MARTA
Yeah but just a tiny bit.
HARLAN
Send me to lala land.  Why did I waittill my mid eighties to become amorphine user, what a schmuck, what anud-nig, this stuff's the best.
She pulls the needle from the second vial... then sees thelabel.  Freezes.  Blinks at it.
MARTA
Oh my god.
She snatches up the first vial she just injected him from. Compares the label to the one she just picked up.  They'resimilar but not the same.
HARLAN
Is there a problem?
MARTA
This is what I just gave you 100milligrams of.  But I messed up. 
HARLAN
You gave me 100 milligrams of thegood stuff.37.She immediately pulls an EMERGENCY KIT from a nearby shelf,
starts calmly but quickly going through its contents.
HARLAN(cont'd)
What's the good stuff dosage supposedto be?
MARTA
Lets not call it that right now -three milligrams.
HARLAN
That's much less.  So what happens?
MARTA
I give you an emergency shot ofNaloxone, so that you don't die inten minutes.
HARLAN
Well no pressure.  You know that's aninteresting, efficient method formurder, I need to write that down.
He gets a little notebook and scribbles while she checks andrechecks the kit contents with increasing urgency.
HARLAN(cont'd)
So if someone switched the meds onpurpose I'd be dead in ten minutes,like stone cold dead?
MARTA
You'll feel symptoms in five. Sweats,disorientation.  Then yeah, that biga dose, injected, within ten yourrespiratory - your - yes ten minutes.
HARLAN
From the time of injection, soeightish now.  And even if the victimcalled an ambulance when he firstfelt symptoms, if he was at a countryhome like this one... where theambulance takes fifteen minutes toarrive, it would be too late.  If thevictim didn't have this emergencyNaxostuff.
He watches her.  She's now digging around the carpet,looking under the couch.  She dumps the entire contents ofthe kit out and is now frantically going through it.  A beadof sweat rolls down Harlan's brow.38.HARLAN(cont'd)
Marta.  Do you have Naxostuff?
MARTA
Yes!  Naloxone yes it comes with the
emergency kit - it should be here,it's - fuck.  No Harlan it's nothere.  It's not. Oh my god.
They look at each other for a second.  She's panicked.  He'sthinking.
MARTA(cont'd)
 Where's my phone?  Shit -
She picks up a landline phone on the table, dials 911 withshaking hands -
Before it can even ring, the line goes dead.She looks, unbelieving:  Harlan's finger is on the cradle.
His eyes are locked with hers, serious and certain.
MARTA(cont'd)
Harlan what are you doing?
HARLAN
Marta, listen to me.
MARTA
Harlan we need to - are youcrazy, we need to call, theyneed to get here I need to -HARLAN
Stop.  Stop stop, Martalisten there isn't time stopnow stop
She goes for her cell phone across the room and Harlan stopsher - they trip and fall to the ground with a KA-THUNK.
MARTA
What are you doing are younuts?HARLAN
Marta it's too late it isover, it's too late I amdead listen.  LISTEN.
He actually puts his hand over her mouth.
HARLAN(cont'd)
Listen.  If what you said is true Iam gone, there's no saving me, wehave six minutes.  There is one lastthing I need to do in this world, andonly you can help me do it.  But youneed to trust me and do everything Isay.39.MARTA
What do you want to do?
HARLAN
Get you out of this.  Think of your
mom - please trust me, we have tomake this look ironclad like it can'thave been your fault.  You.  Can't. Have done this.
MARTA
My mom...?
CREAK on the stairs outside.
HARLAN
Get up.
A knock on the door.
JONI (O.S.)
Harlan?  Marta?  Everything alright?
Harlan and Marta stand.  She's dazed, deer in theheadlights, but he's focused and sharp.  He turns her awayfrom the door.
HARLAN
Stand here, keep your back to me,don't say a word.
Harlan opens the door.  While he gets rid of Joni we stickwith Marta, who stands stock still, tears running down herface, eyes wild - what does she do?
HARLAN(cont'd)
Joni.
JONI
I - hi - I heard something, iseverything ok?
HARLAN
Oh yes we just, I just knocked overthe GO board, sorry about that.
JONI
Everything's alright?
HARLAN
Yes yes all fine, go to bed Joni.40.JONI
Ok.  And maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the, uh, the thing with
HARLAN
Yes.  Tomorrow.
JONI
Love you,  Night.
HARLAN
Night night.
Harlan shuts the door.  Looks at the knife still sticking inthe desk.  Then takes Marta's shoulders, looks in her eyes.
HARLAN(cont'd)
Pay attention now, your mom is stillundocumented, if this is your faultshe'll be found out and at bestdeported, your family will be broken.
A new kind of fear in Marta's eyes.
MARTA
Oh godHARLAN
But we're not going to letthat happen. I have a plan,it's not going to be easybut you have to do exactlywhat I tell you.  Will youdo this Marta?  This lastthing.  For me, and for yourfamily. 
She's terrified.  But she nods.
MARTA
What do you want me to do?
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT OF THE PARTY - FLASHBACK
Walt smoking and Jacob.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
say goodbye loudly.
MARTA (O.S.)
Walt!  I'm leaving!
Marta exits quickly, down to her car.41.HARLAN (V.O.)

Walt checks his watch.
INT. MARTA'S CAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
She drives out the guard gate and down the private road.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive out the gate, then to avoid the
security cameras, pull off the roadBEFORE the carved elephant.
Up ahead - a weathered wood carved elephant statue.
MARTA
Wait... was it before or after?
HARLAN (V.O.)
AFTER the carved elephant.
MARTA
No, he said - before?  Was it?

HARLAN (V.O.)
Take the side yard path, through thatlittle gate.
The DOGS sprint down the moonlit yard from the house towardsMarta.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
The dogs will know you, theyshouldn't bark.
The dogs stop at Marta and lick her hand.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta looks up the side of the looming house.  A sturdy
trellis on the wall, and high above a third story window.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You've got to get up to the thirdfloor without being seen, and theonly way is to climb the side trellisand come in through the trick hallwindow.
MARTA
You've gotta be kidding me.
HARLAN (V.O.)
I am not.  Do it.
Cut to: moments later, Marta climbing the trellis.  It'seasy going until a piece BREAKS under her foot, and sheswings for a second by one hand.
HARLAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
And for godssakes don't make anynoise.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
What appears to be a dead end hallway, with a painting at
the end.  BUT suddenly the end wall swings away like a door,revealing a WINDOW behind it.  Marta heaves her way inthrough it, and steps lightly into Harlan's bedroom.43.HARLAN (V.O.)
Once you're inside, this is the
tricky part.
MARTA (V.O.)
THIS is the tricky part?
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN (V.O.)
Get my robe and cap from my bedroom. And put them on.
She picks them up from the bed.  Stops.  A moment of doubt.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Back to the scene with Harlan.  Marta stops him.
MARTA
Harlan this is - I - this is crazy -
HARLAN
We need to make this so airtight your
average cop will entirely dismiss youas a suspect.  This seems crazy butit will work.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

INT. FOYER - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Marta come down the stairs, and sees the outline of Walt and
Jacob outside through the glazed window windows.44.HARLAN (V.O.)
...through the glazed window.
She holds her breath, a deer in the headlights.
WALT
Dad, go to bed.
Marta heads right back up the stairs.
HARLAN (V.O.)
You were seen leaving, the security
cameras show you driving off, andtwenty minutes later I am seen aliveand well by my son.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
Marta climbs the creaky stairs.

EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT
Marta shimmies down the last of the trellis.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Leave the way you came.  And don't. 
Be.  Seen.
She hops to the ground, then FREEZES and almost shouts.
She's facing a darkened first floor window.  Wide open.  And
inside it, staring RIGHT AT her, is Greatnana.
Marta is frozen.  Greatnana isn't moving either.  Just has
her eyes locked on Marta.
After what seems like forever, Greatnana cocks her head
slightly and asks...
GREATNANA
Ransom?  Are you back again already?45.Marta breathes.  And backs away.  Then turns and goes,
quickly, down across the lawn.
HARLAN (V.O.)
Drive home.  Sometime in the next fewdays the police will question you.
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT
Back to Harlan and Marta.
MARTA
Harlan I can't lie I'll puke
HARLAN
Don't lie.  Tell fragments of the
truth.  In this exact order:
INT. LIBRARY - LATE AFTERNOON
Blanc catches his coin.  Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper
Wagner look up at Marta, expectant.  Just a brief moment haspassed since we left them.
MARTA
I took him upstairs.  We played ournightly game of GO, at some point heknocked the board over and Joni cameup to check on us.  Then I gave himpain medication, he pulled hisshoulder last week, and left him inhis study.  At midnight.  Said bye toWalt, went home.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What medication did he get?
Marta chooses her words very carefully:
MARTA
Since his injury I've been giving hima 100 milligram IV push of Toradol, anon narcotic analgesic.  And to helphim sleep, 3 milligrams of morphine.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Anything unusual about his demeanor?
Uh oh.  Marta keeps it solid. Superhuman effort.46.MARTA
No.
The three men nod.  Blanc holds Marta's gaze.  She holds it
right back.  Then he smiles.
BLANC
Well that sounds about right.  Thankyou Ms. Cabrera.
INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER
Marta walks calmly out of the library.  Then across the
foyer into a small door.
INT. HALF BATH 
Marta walks in, closes the door behind her, locks it, turns
on both the taps, and PUKES into the toilet.
INT. LINDA'S ROOM
Linda stands in her childhood room, by the window in the
ebbing light.  From a shelf she pulls a stack of PINKNOTECARDS, identical to the one Harlan showed Richard in hisoffice.  But these are covered in writing, sweet littlenotes, a father to his daughter.
WALT (O.S.)
Hey sis. People are going to startgetting here for the memorial prettysoon. Are you- Are you alright?
She looks up.  Walt in the doorway.  She wipes her eyes,indicates the notes.
LINDA
I was just thinking about Dad'sgames.  This all feels like one, itfeels like something he'd write, notdo.  I keep waiting for a big reveal,where it all makes sense.  How nicewould that be?
Her little brother hugs her.  His eyes tired and dark.47.INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
HARLAN THROMBEY - his portrait, with an ambiguous look on
his face.
Marta.  Soda water in hand at the reception that night. 
Staring shell shocked at Harlan.
The reception for friends of the family.  Tables of food. 
Twenty or thirty people milling, in dark tasteful clothes,with the whole Thrombey family.
A tearful Fran has cornered Marta, talks through sobs:
FRAN
I don't think he killed himself I
don't.  I don't.  There's thisHallmark movie Deadly By Surprisewhere Danica McKellar plays a wifewho gets poisoned by her husband butbit by bit so she thinks she's goingcrazy and she ends up killingherself, and my cousin who's thereceptionist at the medical examinersoffice says that kind of thing cantotally happen, she says it's noteven like 3% as crazy as stuff she'sseen come through the -
As Fran's talking, Marta looks at the room of familymembers, gathered around talking.  She FLASHES BACK to:
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK - NIGHT
NIGHT OF THE PARTYHarlan and Ransom go off together to have a private talk,
leaving the family having a heated conversation in theliving room.
RICHARD
I don't like him no he's anasshole but maybe anasshole's what we needed

Oh god.  Yeah an asshole's

Marta stays on the outskirts.  Fran, with a tray ofchampagne flutes:48.FRAN
Jesus.  I'm gonna disappear until the
politics talk is done.  You want somechampers?
MARTA
No I'm technically working.  Thanks.
Marta checks her watch. Meanwhile Donna, who's had a few, istearing into the family fight.
DONNA
We're losing our way of lifeand our culture, there'smillions of Mexicans comingand this isn't Joni don'tmake this a race thing, I'dsay the same thing if theywere European immigrants -we allow them in and theythink they own what's oursJONI
Oh god really - yeah it'snot a race thing yeah

RICHARD

For wanting a better lifefor their kids, isn't thatwhat America
RICHARD
For breaking the law.  You're goingto hate hearing this but it's true,America is for Americans. Marta, comehere.
Richard beckons her over, waving his cake plate.  We've seenthis moment before, silent, during Richard's questioning.
LINDA
Oh god don't.
Marta is drawn over next to Richard, very uncomfortable.
RICHARD
No, Marta your family came fromUruguay but you did it right, she didit legally, I'm saying.  You workhard, and you'll earn your share fromthe ground up just like dad and allof us did - Marta I bet you agreewith me. 49.LINDA
Leave the poor girl alone.
RICHARD
No Marta do you agree, I'd like you
to answer - you wanna become anAmerican, there are legal ways to doit, but if you break the law itdoesn't matter if you have a goodheart, you gotta face theconsequences.
At that moment booming shouts begin behind the study door -Harlan and Ransom going at it.  Ransom bursts out.
Marta takes the opportunity to slip into the hallway, alone. 
She breathes hard.  Takes a champagne flute from the tray. Drinks it in one gulp. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
END FLASHBACK.  Marta in the same spot, Fran still talking
her ear off.  The room sways.  Marta sucks in breath, sways,and braces herself against the wall.
FRAN
Oh my god Marta, what?
Meg runs over, rubs her back.
MEG
Whoa hey, c'mere, hey.  What do you,you want water?  Breathe.  Hey.  Franhave you still got your stash?
INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT
Empty and dark, fireplace blazing.  Above the fireplace is
an ornate mantle clock.  Fran uses a key to unlock one ofseveral tiny drawers hidden in its face, takes out a jointand hands it to Meg.
FRAN
Take em whenever you need em -they're just drying out since yougave me that Juul.
MEG
Thanks Fran.
Fran leaves them alone.50.MARTA
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
sorryMEG
Stop saying you're sorryJesus
Meg lights the joint.
MARTA
God my heart won't stop, I can't -it's just everything, no, thank you
she refuses the joint, then realizes where it came from.
MARTA(cont'd)
That's where Fran keeps her stash?
MEG
Who's going to open a clock?
INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt yells at a non responsive, bored Greatnana.
WALT
DO YOU WANT DINNER, NANA? 
DINNER?  TO EAT?  EAT?LINDA
Walt she's fine, she ate thewhole salmon spread already.
Meg grabs Walt, pulls him to Marta.
MEG
Did you tell Marta yet?  What we alltalked about?
WALT
No, not yet, is now a goodtime?MEG
Yes a very good time.  Rightnow.
WALT
Marta.  We've talked it over, and
wait()
Have you been smoking grass?
MEG
No.
WALT
We talked it over and the wholefamily, we want to take care of you.
MARTA
What does that mean?51.MEG
We all think you deserve something.
WALT
Financially, we want to help you out. 
You were never anything but good todad.  Because of that, you can counton us.
Walt embraces her, Meg puts a hand on her back.
Over Walt's shoulder, Marta sees Harlan's portrait again. 
Has its expression changed?  It looks like it has a slightconspiratorial smile.  Marta breathes - maybe this is allgoing to be ok.
WALT(cont'd)
I thought you should have been at thefuneral, by the way.  I was outvoted.
EXT. SIDE PORCH - NIGHT
Later.  Marta comes out to get some air.  Exhales deeply.And then jumps - she's not alone.  Benoit Blanc sits in a
wicker chair in the dark, smoking a long thin cigar.
MARTA
Wah ha. Detective. You're still here?
BLANC
Mm.
Silence.  Blanc smokes and stares at Marta.  Marta shifts.
MARTA
Did you know Harlan?
BLANC
He knew my father who was a policedetective.  Years ago. My fatherrespected Harlan. That says quite alot.
MARTA
So that's why you're here?
BLANC
Here now here?  No.  I stayed hopingto speak to you a little more.52.MARTA
Uh?
BLANC
Something is afoot with this whole
affair.  I know it, and I believe youknow it.
MARTA
So you're... going to keep digging.
BLANC
Harlan's detectives they dig, theyrifle and root, truffle pigs.  Ianticipate the terminus of gravity'srainbow.
MARTA
Gravity's Rainbow.
BLANC
It's a novel.
MARTA
I know.  I haven't read it. 
BLANC
Neither have I.  Nobody has. But Ilike the title.  It describes thepath of a projectile, determined bynatural law.  Voila, my method.  Iobserve the facts without biases ofthe head or heart, I determine thearc's path, stroll leisurely to itsterminus, and the truth falls at myfeet.
beat()
The medical examiner was ready torule this a suicide, but Elliottagreed to keep it pending for fortyeight hours.  Tomorrow morning Isearch the grounds and the house,begin my investigation.  I want youto be by my side for it.  Myconfidant, my eyes and ears.
MARTA
What but - why me?53.BLANC
I trust your kind heart.  Also you
are the only one who had nothing togain from Harlan's death.  So. Watson.
Blank puts out his cigar, stands.
MARTA
You want my insight into this family? None of them are murderers.  That'smy insight.
BLANC
And yet.  Be it cruel or comforting,this machine unerringly arrives atthe truth.  That's what it does.
MARTA
Always?
He does a little bow.
BLANC
Tomorrow at eight.
Marta watches him go.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Marta gets home.  Her mom is on the couch, zoning out in
front of the TV, still in a cleaning uniform.  Without aword Marta sits next to her.  Stares at the TV.
Off her eyes, we FLASH BACK with her:
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
HARLAN
I know I missed something... there's
going to be something I missed.  ButI know you can beat it.  Withoutlosing your soul you have to do whatyou have to do to beat this, and win.
MARTA
I can't.
HARLAN
You can and you have to.  For me. Right now.54.She's out the door and he shuts it.
INT. OUTSIDE HARLAN'S ATTIC OFFICE DOOR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Marta stands frozen.  Soft voices of Walt and Jacob float up
from downstairs.  She turns back to the door.
Silence.  Moments going by.  Shit.  Can she do this?  Shit.No.  She turns and pushes back into the office -
INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
MARTA
Harlan I have to get you help -
Harlan reclines on the couch in the middle of the room,
ornate dagger against his throat.  Marta's eyes go wide.
HARLAN
Do what I say and everything's goingto be ok, Marta.  I promise.
She makes a move to stop him and with one quick motion heDRAWS THE DAGGER across his throat.  Blood sprays.
She leaps back, hands to her mouth, spins and leaves the
room, closing the door behind her.
EXT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Breathing hard,  silent crying.  Then her breathing slows. 
Her brain taking over.  Resolve settling.  The dice arethrown.  She wipes her eyes.  Then bounds down the stairs,out of frame.
INT. CABRERA LIVING ROOM
Back to Marta and her mom on the couch.  She puts her hand
on Mom's knee.
MARTA
Everything's going to be ok.  Ipromise.
MOM
of course( )
I know.55.They go back to watching TV.  But Marta's mind is buzzing.
On her white sneaker, we see but she does not - one single
drop of blood.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE GUARD GATE - MORNING
The gate is open, Marta's car pulls up just inside it.  The
small Guard house next to the gate,  Blanc, Elliott andWagner outside it. Blanc waves to her.
INT. GUARD HOUSE
Thrombey's security man, MR PROOFROC, guides them into the
cramped dusty space.  Proofroc is old and salty.  He showsthem old photos of the house, stuck to a steel fridge withbig brightly colored fruit magnets.
MR PROOFROC
Fifty years I worked this estate, youknow security back then meant makingthe rounds with a 94, keeping yourears open.  Before all this moderntechnology.
Nothing in the room is newer than 1988.  An 8 inch CRTmonitor shows a phosphorescent live feed of the road outsidethe gate, and a top loaded VHS VCR sits next to it.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
Well the video here, I saved the tapefrom that night, usually I erase 'emwith the magnetic de-gauser, but Ithought better save that one.  Cause,security.  That's the live feedthere.
Marta notices something with alarm - the video feed showsthe road outside, and at the top edge you can just barelysee the carved elephant that marks the gardener's utilityroad.  She realizes Harlan said
HARLAN (V.O.)
...to avoid the security cameras,pull off the road AFTER the carvedelephant.
Marta keeps a poker face, but.. shit.56.LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
to Proofroc( )
Can we see the actual TAPE?
MR PROOFROC
Oh sure.
CLACK!  The tape loads into the mechanical VCR.  An
impossibly grainy, smeared night vision view of the roadoutside the gate.  Time stamp: 10:02pm.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's like a Japanese horror movie.
MR PROOFROC
proud()
I record it SSLP, gets eight hoursper tape.  Nine pm to five am.
BLANC
Can we -
to Marta( )
Can we scan forward?MARTA
to Proofroc( )
Can we scan forward?
MR PROOFROC
Hold the play button down and pressthe FF down halfway till you feel itgrind.
Wagner does, the machine makes horrible noises and thepicture frizzles and frazzles.  Then stops and ejects.
MR PROOFROC (cont'd)
And hold the tape down or it'lleject.
BLANC
Can your guys digitize it so we canscan it properly?
TROOPER WAGNER
I'm sure we can.
MARTA
I got it.
Marta grabs the tape from the VCR.
EXT. WOODS - DAY
They all hack through the overgrown gardener's path.57.TROOPER WAGNER
You know all these statues that you
see around here - they are allstraight out of his series the"menagerie tragedy series", prettycool.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
     (dry)Awesome.  Blanc the grounds arelovely but you think what, someonebroke into the house?  To killHarlan?  Is that why we're out here?
BLANC
I think it's an unlikely but if theydid, there will be traces.
TROOPER WAGNER
I'll take that, thanks ma'am.
Marta hands Wagner the VHS tape.  Then she discretelypockets something she had held in her hand next to it - afew of the bright fruit MAGNETS from Proofroc's fridge.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
The group hikes up out of the woods, towards the low wall
with a small pedestrian gate that leads to the east lawn.
Marta is out in front.  During the following, she notices
something:  The earth around and under the gate is soft andbare.  And clear as day: HER FOOTPRINTS from the othernight, the only ones from women's shoes. The same ones shehas on now.  Her breath catches. SHIT.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Any luck with - whatshisname?
TROOPER WAGNER
Ransom.  No, but we have an address. Ten Kenoak street.
BLANC
Ten Kenoak.  That's a pleasant thingto say.  kenoak.  I awoke amidKenoak.
TROOPER WAGNER
Ugh this mud, my boots are going tostink.58.BLANC
Mud - has it rained the past week? 
No - Nobody move!  Freeze!  Everyone! These footprints must not bedisturbed!
sees()
Marta!
Marta has already walked through the pedestrian gate and uponto the lawn, stepping in her pre-existing prints.  Sheturns back, playing dumb.
MARTA
What?
BLANC
Don't - stop there, don't -
MARTA
I can't hear you, what?
She trots back to them through the gate, stepping into herreturning prints.
BLANC
No no no no don't - don't step onthe, ok, alright.  Aughhhhh ok.
MARTA
What?
Blanc sidesteps up to the gate, not stepping in the mud.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Alright, Wagner let's get the boys onit, check the prints, tape off thisarea, keep it clear.
The dogs come running down the lawn, barking at the men. They tear through the gate, further messing up the mud.
MARTA
Hey boys, easy.  Hey.  Hey.
She pets them and they quiet down.
BLANC
Best judge of character is a dog. I've found that to be true.
The dogs start BARKING and bolt towards the house, whereRichard and Linda are pulling up in their lux SUV.59.LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
They're doing the will reading at
ten, whole family will be here soon. 
Elliott heads up towards the house.  Blanc meanders up thelawn, and Marta follows.
MARTA
I've never been to a will reading.
BLANC
You think it'll be like a game show. No.  Imagine a community theaterperformance of a tax return.
They approach the side of the house.  Blanc does a gentle,meandering study of the layout.
Marta steals a look at the trellis she climbed.Oh no.  A piece of the white lattice trellis that broke off
when she was climbing - about eight inches long - lies inthe grass beneath it.  Her eyes dart up - yup, there's thebroken spot.  Shit.
BLANC(cont'd)
SWEET BEANS
Marta starts - did he spot it?  No - he's come face to facewith Greatnana, standing stock still on the porch.  Shestares at him like a bird.
BLANC(cont'd)
Good morning Mrs. Thrombey.
He approaches her, slowly.  When his back is fully turnedMarta takes her shot and KICKS the piece of trellis undersome thick bushes at the base of the house.
Blanc and Greatnana stare at each other.  Blanc gets very
close to her, great sympathy in his eyes.  Greatnana staresback.  It's almost like they're communicating.  This goes onfor a little too long.  Then Blanc breaks from the trance,and turns to Marta.
BLANC(cont'd)
Do you think you could handle thestudy?60.INT. HARLAN THROMBEY'S STUDY
The blood is now only a subtle dark stain, but other than
that the room has been left intact from the night of theparty.  Marta and Wagner observe as Blanc paces the room.
BLANC
to Marta( )
Where's your medical bag?
MARTA
I... don't know - I left it here, Ialways leave it with Harlan at night.
TROOPER WAGNER
They must have taken it in asevidence.  I'll check on it.
Blanc picks up the GO board and sets it on the table. Examines its grid idly.
BLANC
How'd the GO board get knocked over?
MARTA
We were just goofing around.
beat()
What are you thinking?
Blanc sighs gently, turns the baseball over in his hands. Looks like this was a bust.
Blanc tips the GO board over, and it lands on the carpet
with a nearly inaudible WHOMPH.  He stares at it.
But his concentration is broken by sharp barking outside. 
They go to the tiny window and look out.  A DASHING MAN inhis early 30s climbs out of a vintage Porsche.  The dogs goNUTS, biting at his pant legs.
BLANC
Let me guess.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
The man kicks off the dogs and limps toward the house,
cursing.  Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner step outonto the porch.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hugh Drysdale? 61.RANSOM
Ransom.  Call me Ransom, my middle
name.  The help call me Hugh.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
I'm Lieutenant Elliott, this isofficer Wagner, we'd like to ask youa few questions about the night of
RANSOM
Uh huh.
He blows past them and into the house.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Walt, Donna and Jacob (nose in his phone) sit around the
room.  Linda and Richard stand, on their phones.  Ransombreezes in, bumping Donna who YELPS, startled.
Elliott and Wagner follow.
TROOPER WAGNER
Sir excuse me, we are officers of the
law.
RANSOM
You gonna run me in?  I don't feellike talking.  I'm distraught.
Ransom disappears into the kitchen, comes out eating asleeve of pinwheel cookies.
Blanc and Marta slip in.  Elliott nods to Blanc.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc, anything you need to ask him?
RANSOM
The hell anyway is this arrangement?
BLANC
Mr. Drysdale
Ransom sizes up Blanc with a grin.
RANSOM
CSI KFC?
Ransom grabs Fran the housekeeper's sleeve as she walks by.62.RANSOM(cont'd)
Hey Frannie can you get me a glass of
cold milk?
Meg and Joni have just entered, and Meg heard this.
MEG
Hey asshole.  Not her name, not herjob.
Fran walks off with a scorching look at Ransom.
RANSOM
Meg.  How's your SJW degree coming?
MEG
Trust fund prick.JONI
Alright.  Guys.
ALAN STEVENS, the family's attorney, knocks and enters withan assistant, SALLY, who juggles several attache cases.
ALAN
Hey everyone.  Hey.  I'm just goingto set up in the other room, be readyin ten minutes.
They go off to the library, leaving the family all togetherin tense silence.
WALT
Funny Ransom, you skipped the funeralbut you're early for the willreading.
JONI
Ok, people grieve in different ways,let's not
WALT
to Ransom( )
It's funny you're here at all.  Whyare you even bothering, that's what Iwant to know.
RICHARD
What's that supposed to mean?
WALT
He knows what it means.
LINDA
Walt, what?63.WALT
Jacob was in that bathroom the night
of the party.
JONI
Is that where you were all night?
RICHARD
The hell were you doing in thebathroom all night?
JACOB
Nothing.
MEG
Swatting Syrian refugees.
JACOB
No.
MEG
Alt right troll.
JACOB
Liberal snowflake.
WALT
I don't know what any of that means
RICHARD
It means your son's a little creep.
WALT
Oh MY son's a creep?
JONI
Guys!  Walt he was in the bathroom...
WALT
He was in the bathroom
RICHARD
Joylessly masturbating to pictures ofdead deer.
WALT
Ok you wanna go?
They go at each other and do some half-hearted slap-fightingbefore Linda and Joni break them apart.  Ransom's lovingthis.64.RANSOM
We gotta do this more often.
LINDA
Alright!  Enough.  Jacob, we get
where this is going.  The bathroom'snext to Harlan's office, where he hadthe big fight with Ransom.  You heardsomething.  Spill it.
JACOB
I just heard two things.
INT. HALF BATH - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Jacob on the toilet, hearing non distinct yelling through a
vent high in the wall.  But two words poke through:
HARLAN (O.S.)
...my will!
INT. LIVING ROOM
JACOB
And then there was more shouting, butI also heard Ransom say "I'm warningyou."
Walt raises his arms, triumphant.
LINDA
Ransom?  What's this mean?
He just eats cookies, silent.
WALT
It means dad finally came to hissenses and cut this worthless lazybrat out of the will.
to Ransom( )
And you better sell your littleBeamer and you better give yournotice at that country club and kickwhatever fashion drugs you're oncause if you think after the bridgesyou've burned, the shit you've saidand what you've put this familythrough for the past ten years thatany of us are going to support you,are going to give you like dad usedto say a single red dime you're nuts.65.Ransom looks around the room.  Cold faces.
RICHARD
Son.
RANSOM
mock gravity( )
Father?
RICHARD
Did Harlan tell you he was cutting
you out of the will?
RANSOM
Yes.
RICHARD
Then he's done what we weren't strongenough to do - this might finallymake you grow up.
Ransom is really slapped by this but he doesn't let it show.
LINDA
I think it might be the best thingthat could happen to you.
RANSOM
Thanks - my mother, folks.
JONI
It won't be easy for you but it'll begood.  Nothing good is ever easy.
RANSOM
Up your ass Joni, you've gotyour teeth bit into thisfamily tit so hardMEG
Oh 'up your ass' very niceyou homophobic privileged -
RANSOM
going down the line( )
As a matter of fact - Eat shit, howsthat? In fact eat shit, eat shit -eat shit - Definitely eat shit. Eatshit.
And now everyone is shouting at each other.
Blanc has heard enough.  He sets the baseball down on a side
table, and drifts out.  Marta follows him.66.EXT. FRONT PORCH
Blanc breathes in the air.  Marta joins him.  From inside
the house, the shouting continues.
MARTA
What was that about will readingsbeing boring?
BLANC
Exception that proves the rule.
Fran bursts out of the living room, muttering
FRAN
Asshole.
She storms off around the house.  A beat of thought.  Then:
BLANC
I'm warning you.  Ransom said.  I'mwarning you.
One of the dogs bounds up the steps to Blanc. 
MARTA
You heard Ransom in there, it's thekind of thing he says. 
When Blanc goes to pet him, the dog drops something to hisfeet with a clatter.  Marta freezes.
MARTA(cont'd)
What's he got there?  Hey boy.  Youfind a stick?  He's always bringingjunk into the house -
It's the piece of broken trellis.  Blanc picks it up,examines it, and suddenly his eyes go sharp.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD
Holding the piece up as he studies the trellis that runs up
the side of the house.  Marta runs up beside him.
BLANC
This looks like a relatively freshbreak - yes.  Right there.
He's spotted the broken spot on the trellis.  Just up fromit, what looks like a boarded window.67.BLANC(cont'd)
Wait - that doesn't make sense,
where's that window?
INT. LIVING ROOM
The whole family in a screaming match, but Blanc and Marta
walk through and up the stairs.  Three people notice: Elliott and Wagner (who follow) and Ransom (who doesn't.)
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING
Blanc looks down the "dead end" hallway.  Marta joins him,
out of breath.
BLANC
Show me, but don't step on thecarpet.
It's a runner rug, and Marta delicately steps on the woodsiding as she goes to the wall with the painting. And swingsit open, revealing the window.
TROOPER WAGNER
It's the trick window!  From "A KillFor All Seasons!"
Elliott and Wagner at the top of the stairs, and Blancmotions them not to approach.
BLANC
Off the carpet!
He drops down to his knees, removes a loupe from his jacket,and holds it in his eye.  Then, his face inches from thecarpet, he scans it.  All the way to the window.  Thenstops.
BLANC(cont'd)
Traces of dried mud.  I suspect theygo the length of the hallway.
MARTA
Footprints?
BLANC
No, just traces.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Depending on when it was lastcleaned, it could be from anytime68.BLANC
But that would not explain this.
He motions to the base of the window sill - obvious scuffs
of dried mud.  Marta winces.
Blanc tosses the piece of trellis to Elliott.
BLANC(cont'd)
Analyze this mud. It will match these
traces, and you will find similarsamples leading up the trellis on theside of the house.

On the night of the party, somebodywho did not want to be heard climbingthe steps went to a great deal oftrouble to break into HarlanThrombey's rooms.  The game is afoot,eh Watson?
INT. LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER
The whole family assembled.  Marta stands in the back, with
Blanc, Elliott and Trooper Wagner.
Alan Stevens, Harlan's attorney, sits at a table with papers
in front of him, assistant Sally beside him.
ALAN
Well.  Thank you all for gettingtogether like this, it isn't legallynecessary but I thought becauseyou're all in town and some of youare leaving soon, it would be best -
BLANC
Excuse me Mr. Stevens.  As to that,ladies and gentlemen, I'd like togently request you all remain in townuntil the investigation is completed. Shouldn't be more than two days.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
He's gently requesting, I'm ordering. Nobody move until we figure this out.
Nobody likes this.
LINDA
What?69.JONI
Can we ask why?  Has something
changed?
BLANC
No.
JONI
No it hasn't changed or no we can'task?
BLANC
Mr. Stevens, please continue.
ALAN
Right.  Well the other reason Ithought this gathering would be, uh,beneficial is that as I told Walt,Harlan altered his will one week ago. He sealed it and asked me not tosubmit it to the courts for probateuntil after his death.  So in casethere's any confusion about anythingwe're all together, we can talk.  Ican't imagine any of it will be thatcomplicated, Harlan's assets includedum
SALLY
...the house
ALAN
the house which he owned outright, um
SALLY

ALAN
right in various cash accounts andinvestments, yes and of course thereal assets are sole ownership of um

ALAN
Blood Like Wine publishing, hispublishing company.  Ok.
Walt's wife puts her hand on his knee.  He squeezes it,smiled tightly.70.ALAN(cont'd)
Um, he did write up a statement when
he made the recent changes, he wantedit read first, so:
reads()
"Some of you may be surprised by thechoice I've made here.  No pleasurewas taken in the exclusion, and itspurpose was not to sow greaterdiscord in the family, quite theopposite.  Please accept it withgrace and without bitterness.  But doaccept it.  It's for the best."
Gently condescending eyes shift to Ransom.  Linda sees this,puts her hand on her son's hand, and he immediately gets upand moves to a chair in the corner.
Alan's assistant hands him an envelope and he removes a
single sheet of paper with one short typed paragraph.
ALAN(cont'd)
Ok.  So - oh wow, yeah, not complexat all.  This'll be quick.  "I HarlanThrombey, being of sound mind andbody, yada yada, my assets bothliquid and otherwise, I leave intheir entirety to Marta Cabrera.  Myentire ownership of Blood Like Winepublishing I leave in its entirety toMarta Cabrera.  The copyright of itscatalog likewise I leave in itsentirety to Marta Cabrera.
The air around Marta's head goes away.  The room spins She's not sure what's happening.  Blanc is looking at her. The whole family is looking at her.
Walt bursts out of his chair and grabs the will

No no no no Alan this can't be legal,there are, we're his family
WALT
We're his family, Alan heobviously wasn't,something - I don't knowwhat but something wasn'tright hereRICHARD
Are there safeguards againstthis?
And from the back of the room, slowly rising above the dinof confusion and cursing, slowly drawing even Marta's deerin the headlights attention... Ransom.  LAUGHING.  Loud andweirdly sincerely, tears down his cheeks, laughing his headoff.
JONI
Alan there's a mistake
MEG
Mom if it's what granddadwantedJONI
No this is a mistake, thisis ours.

No, we need to talk and we need tofight this thing and we're not goinganywhere.  GET OUT!  We're theThrombeys goddammit!  This is stillour house!72.A beat of silence.  Then all eyes go to Alan.  Who looks
down at the will.  His assistant Sally points helpfully.
ALAN
Sorry, there's, uh.  "Likewise thehouse at two Deerborn Drive and allbelongings therein I leave to MartaCabrera.
Linda goes for Marta.

The whole family is coming towards her like zombies.  Blanctakes her by the arm and steers her towards the door.
BLANC
I think heads have to cool a little,and in the meanwhile I'd maybe run.73.EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE
Marta stumbles out of the house in a daze.  Behind her, the
entirety of the family floods out after her, shoutingreassurances and questions and accusations and a general dinof confusion.
MARTA
I - I have no idea why he - I justneed to think - I'll call you or havehim call me or do something I don'tknow
She gets in her car and slams the door, and it's instantlylike A Hard Day's Night - the family gathered around tryingto talk through the window and rapping to get her attention.
Marta keys the ignition - chug chug chug.  Nothing.  Oh god,
not now - chug chug chug.  It won't turn over.
Richard opens the door, she pulls it closed again and locks
it, this is like a horror movie.  Blanc is trying to get thefamily to back off but no dice.
Marta puts her head in her hands, all of it swirling and
echoing and horrifying, she has no idea what to do.
HONK!She turns - a honking car pulls up right beside her and
through the family crowd she sees Ransom in his Porsche,waving "get in."  With no other options she pushes out ofher car and through the family and JUMPS IN with him.
As he GUNS IT and careens out of the driveway he shouts back
at the family with a wave
RANSOM
I think this could be the best thingto happen to all of you!
And they're gone.  The family keeps shouting at each other.
Blanc watches the Porsche recede, his expression unreadable. 
DING!  His phone buzzing.  He checks it.  His expressiondarkens.
INT. RANSOM'S PORSCHE
Tearing down the private road, away from the house.  He's
still laughing, she's still shell shocked.  Slowly, hislaughter eases to a stop.  A moment of silence.74.RANSOM
Ok seriously though, what the hell?
She shakes her head, looks at him.  What the hell indeed.
EXT. ROADSIDE FAMILY RESTAURANT - LATER
The Porsche parked out front.
INT. RESTAURANT - CORNER BOOTH
Tucked into a dark corner, Marta is miserable.  Ransom is
bemused, but regards her closely.
They sit in silence.  A waitress sets a sausage plate down.
RANSOM
to the waitress( )
Could we get an extra bowl please?
to Marta( )
You look like you're gonna pass out. 
Have you eaten all day?  Eat.
She joylessly shovels food in her mouth, starving.
MARTA
This is a nightmare.
RANSOM
Uh huh.  So why.
MARTA
Why
RANSOM
Why.  Hey, this is everything. Therehas to be a bigger reason why and youknow it.
MARTA
Well Ransom how about it had more todo with you guys than with me.
RANSOM
agrees()
Yeah.
beat()
Yeah that's the only thing that makessense.75.Marta is unexpectedly effected by this.  The waitress
breezes by, sets an empty bowl on the table.
MARTA
Did he tell you anything?
RANSOM
Just I wasn't getting a cent.
MARTA
He wanted you to buildsomething from the groundup, like your parentsRANSOM
something from the groundup, like my parents
RANSOM(cont'd)
yeah.  My mom built her business fromthe ground up with a million dollarloan from granddad.  My dad owns noneof it, and mom made him sign aprenup.  He lives in fear.I know that's what granddad wanted toprotect me from by doing this, and Iknow I shouldn't say this out loudbut when he told me, Jesus Christ Icoulda killed him.
beat()
After I left the party, though.  Iwas driving fast, nowhere, just inthe night.  And I got this weird...clarity.  That from here on I wasgoing to have to do for myself.  Andthat felt... good.  The old bastard.
beat()
Marta I know three things.  One: Iknow he didn't commit suicide.
MARTA
What makes you think that
RANSOM
I don't think it.  I know it.  CauseI knew my granddad. So you're notgoing to bullshit me.  Because two: I know lying makes you puke.  Causeof that mafia game last fourth ofJuly.
Marta sinks back, suddenly nervous.
RANSOM(cont'd)
And three.  I know that you just atea full plate of sausage and bakedbeans.76.She looks down at her empty plate.  Oh no.  He pushes the
large empty bowl in front of her.
RANSOM(cont'd)
So look me in the eye.  And tell mewhat really happened to my granddad.
Her lip quivers.  She looks like she might attempt it.  Butthen tears drop from her eyes.
MARTA
You bastard.
Ransom pull the bowl away, and puts his hand on hers.
RANSOM
Marta.  Tell me everything.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE - EVENING
Dusk settles heavy.  Warm light from the windows.

There have to be options here.
ALAN (O.S.)
No.  I don't know how many times I

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Lit by a fire in the fireplace, the whole family pacing
around, Alan the lawyer looking very tired seated at a tablein the center of the room.
ALAN

WALT
Yes!  Undue influence!
ALAN

Did you just google that?
WALT
If Marta was manipulating dad
somehow, if we found out that she had
LINDA
Gotten her hooks into himWALT
Somehow or something
ALAN
You need a strong case for that. You've got nothing.  "She endearedherself to him through hard work andgood humor" won't cut the salami.
JONI
What about the slayer rule?
All eyes turn to her.  Her face is lit by her phone.
JONI(cont'd)
I did just google that.
ALAN
The slayer rule obviously does notapply here.
RICHARD
What the hell is the slayer rule?
JONI
It's if someone is convicted ofkilling the person they can't gettheir inheritance.
ALAN
Not even convicted, even if they'reheld responsible for their death incivil court
WALT
Like OJALAN
Like OJ, yes.  But Harlancommitted suicide.78.All eyes turn to Blanc, who this whole time has been sitting
in a chair by the fire, lost in thought.
JONI
Detective Blank.  You said that theinvestigation is continuing.  Youmade a point of that.  Do you suspectfoul play?
BLANC
Mister Blanc.  If you please.
beat()
There is much that remains unclear. But yes. I suspect foul play.
The eruption you would expect breaks out.
RICHARD
Marta?
BLANC
I have eliminated no suspects.
RICHARD
You're full of shit, I don't trustthis guy in the tweed suit, and Alangod bless you you're useless.
ALAN
Thank you.
Alan takes that as an excuse to leave.
RICHARD
There's one answer to this:  she canrenounce the inheritance.
WALT
She knows it's what sheshould do, it's the rightthing to do.LINDA
We've gotta make her do theright thing.
Meg rounds on her mom, speaks quietly, in tears.
MEG
Mom.  If Granddad wanted Marta tohave everything, that's what hewanted.
JONI
No, this was not him.  He loved us,he wanted us taken care of.  Hewanted you to have an education. 
(MORE)79.Meg.  You think I can pay for yourJONI(cont'd)
school?
This leaves Meg shaken.
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Beer bottles now stacked up in front of Ransom.  Marta has
just told Ransom everything.  He stares into space, andmakes the slightest hint of a laugh which I'll write as:
RANSOM
Heuh.
MARTA
I know, just saying it it soundsinsane but it's all true.  I thinkBlanc's been on to me from thestart - I don't care if I go to jail,but my mom... my sister, we can't -
Nothing but silence from Ransom.  Maybe he's deep inthought.  A strange glint in his eye.
MARTA(cont'd)
You going to say something?
RANSOM
I always thought I was the only onewho could beat Granddad at GO.  Ialways thought that meant something.
MARTA
I know you did.
RANSOM
At the party, that night, my lastconversation with him, our lastfight, that's what he told me, aboutyou.  That you beat him nearly everytime.  More than me.  And I thoughtwhat a strange thing to tell me.  ButI think I get it now.  I think it didmean something.

I'm not telling the family shit. You're not going to jail.  Thatdetective is not going to catch you. And you're not giving up the familyfortune.

this through, this was what he wanted
not just for you but for his family,and for him.  And yes for you. You've come this far. Let me help yougo all the way.
Marta looks at him hard.
MARTA
This isn't you.  You could turn me inright now and get your cut of theinheritance.  Why?
RANSOM
Because fuck my family.  They don'tdeserve any of this.  I can help youand we can fool them all and get awaywith it... and then you will give memy cut of the inheritance.  Theperfect ending, we all win.  You, meand Harlan.  Deal?
Silence.  Broken by Marta's phone ringing.  On the phoneID - "MEG T"
Marta takes a breath, looks at Ransom.  And picks it up.
MARTA

MARTA

you going to do?
Marta looks at Ransom.  What indeed.
MARTA
What do you think I should do?
MEG (ON PHONE)
You should do what you think is...right.  I think you should give itback to us.  Granddad always tookcare of us, we're his family, I knowhe was like family to you but we'rehis actual family.  Marta you knowthis isn't fair, we've always beengood to you and we're going to takecare of you, everyone loves you andyou're like family and we'll takecare of you but you have to makethings right, you know what's right.
Marta, keeping eye contact with Ransom.  Then, her voicequavering, Meg drops what is for her the big bomb:
MEG (ON PHONE) (cont'd)
Marta, mom's broke, she says I'llhave to drop out of school.
MARTA
No, no.  I won't let that happen.

comprehending what she's just heard.

And once I get the -82.Meg hangs up, lets the phone drop from her ear.  Tears in
her eyes.  She turns to her whole family gathered behindher, silent and expectant.

Marta realizes the connection's dead, holds the phone in her
hand like something delicate she just broke.
RANSOM
Ok then.  Did the detective findanything suspicious at the house?
MARTA

Mud.  Tracks upstairs - where I brokein through the window.
Ransom winces.

She wakes to a sharp rapping at her door.  Her sister Alice
pokes her head in, flustered.

Marta lifts her head from her hands.

turns.  They look into each others eyes.84.BLANC
Good Morning Mrs. Thrombey. 
A long pause as he thinks of exactly the right word.
BLANC(cont'd)
Why is grief the providence of youth?
I don't know.  But I'd imagine thatage deepens all feelings.  Includinggrief.  This was a long walk tooffering condolences for the loss ofyour son. And asking you if it isn'tpresumptuous of me to not think tooharshly of your family, if I am as Isuspect the first to console you. They're young aren't they.
Blanc sits.
BLANC(cont'd)
One thing I do assume of age isweariness.  Damned if I don't getmore tired every day.  Tired of whatI do.  Following arcs, like lobbedrocks.  The inevitability of truth. But the complexity and the gray liesnot in the truth but what you do withthe truth once you have it.
Greatnana's eyes move slightly.
BLANC(cont'd)
I think you have something you wantto tell me.  I think you're veryperceptive and very capable oftelling me what you saw the night ofyour son's party.  But I'll happilywait.  I'm in no rush.  I find itquite pleasant.  Sitting here withyou.

Dim and dingy.  Marta comes out of their apartment door,
then jump, startled - at the end of the hall, lurking: Walt.
MARTA
Hey.
Walt's eyes are rimmed red.  His heavy cane taps.
WALT
Hey.
They're not sure what to do so they awkwardly hug.  Martastill has the envelopes in her hands.

You're still very important to all of
us, I want you to know that.
MARTA
I haven't even looked at all thisyet, this legal stuff, is this fromyou guys? 
Marta flips through the envelopes, squinting.
WALT
it isn't from us.  Maybe just locallawyers and accountants who saw thenews and want to jump on it, I'd becareful of it all.
One envelope sticks out - a blank plain letter sizedenvelope, no postage, no return address.
WALT(cont'd)
Marta.  Is it your intention torenounce the inheritance?
MARTA
This is what Harlan wanted.
WALT
Well.  Harlan has put you in a veryhard position here.  It was unfair ofhim.  
Walt's hand on his cane.  Gripping tight.

You're saying even if it came tolight, with the family's resourcesyou could help me fix it.

Yes.  The right lawyers, none ofthose local guys but New Yorklawyers, DC lawyers, enough resourcesput towards it, yes.  But there's noneed it should ever even come up. But yes.

Ok.  Good.
WALT
Ok?
MARTA
Cause Harlan gave me all yourresources.  So that means with myresources I'll be able to fix it.  SoI guess I'm going to go find theright lawyers.

He shuffles towards her.  For the first time she feels ahint of physical threat, and backs up quick into herapartment.
WALT(cont'd)
You better be sure you want to -
She slams the door
INT. CABRERA KITCHEN
and leans against it, breathing hard.  But angry and
focused.  She dumps the legal envelopes in the trash butkeeps the mysterious envelope, opens it and pulls out:88.Half a sheet of paper, roughly torn.  A photocopy of the
header of some sort of medical document, "OFFICE OF THECHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER"  Under that, a photocopy of a tagwith her name on it.  And hand written in block letters atthe top:  "I KNOW WHAT YOU DID."
Marta's phone BUZZES, and she jumps.  Caller ID:  "maybe B
BLANC".  She hesitates, then sends it voicemail.  Looks atthe mysterious letter in her hands.
INT. RANSOM'S LIVING ROOM
Ransom studies the mysterious letter.  Marta pushes aside a
stack of New Yorkers and sits on the couch.
RANSOM
Well I don't know what this is from
Indicating the tag photocopy with her name.
MARTA
It's my medical bag tag.  They havemy medical bag.  For some reason.
RANSOM
OK, but this is just a photocopy ofthe header of a blood toxicologyreport, from the local crime lab.  OnHarlan.  Marta, it would show themorphine overdose.
MARTA
So I'm screwed!  How do you know allthis stuff?
RANSOM
I was Harlan's research assistant. For a summer.

The cop car pulls past an identifying sign into the parking
lot of a one story stand alone building, joining severalother cop cars, and fire trucks.  Journalists kept at bay.
The building is a charred brick husk.  Black smoke, debris. 
It's been gutted with an explosion and a blazing fire.
Blanc steps out of the cop car and finds Lieutenant Elliott.
BLANC
What's the cheese?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Five AM, security systems here was
all triggered.  It went up quick. Blood stores, records, all gone.  Noemployees around, thank god.

Elliott gestures wearily to the charred remains of asecurity camera on the smoking shell of an awning.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
And speaking of security, thesecurity tape from the Thrombeyresidence was scrambled.  For somereason.
Blanc unsurprised.  He motions back to the building.

Holy shit.  This is insane.90.Ransom looks at her - yeah it's likely.  They both
instinctively duck down in case the cops look over.
MARTA(cont'd)
Who would blow up a whole realofficial building just to blackmailme?
RANSOM
Marta this means that the blackmailerhas the only paper copy of the thingthat can prove your guilt. You didn'tget any other instructions, no phonecall no email, no nothing?
Marta looks stunned.  She stabs at her phone, quick swipes.
MARTA

Blanc begins to walk straight towards Marta.  Quickly andwith purpose.  Shouts something, Lieutenant Elliott follows.
RANSOM(cont'd)

paces from the car.  Closing in fast.

She sits up, throws the car in gear and FLOORS IT.

"Ransom came back" she said.  I don'tknow what he came back to do, butwe'll find out.94.Marta looks at Ransom - oh no.  Senile Greatnana thought she

Did he ask you to drive when he sawme coming?
Ransom's being led to the police car.  Marta decides:

Yes.

Her foot hits something on the dirty concrete floor.96.HER MEDICAL BAG. 
She kneels, picks it up gently.Next to where it was lying, she finds something else
curious - the burned remnants of a piece of paper.  Only acharred corner remains.
She turns her attention back to the room.  Creeps forward.
MARTA(cont'd)
Hello?
Ahead - a silhouette.  A person.  Seated in a chair, in the
center of the room.  Silent, facing her.
MARTA(cont'd)

Hello?
Marta takes a step closer, lifts her phone, and turns on itsflashlight.
Illuminating the ghostly face of FRAN, the housekeeper.Marta, barely breathing:
MARTA(cont'd)

A SPIDER crawls across Fran's face.  Marta STIFLES A SCREAM
and leaps back, sucking in air. 
A moment of stillness.  Her phone BUZZES - Blanc calling. 
Marta ignores the call, frozen.
Her eyes go to:  A white letter sized ENVELOPE in Fran's
hand, resting on her lap.
Marta swallows.  Leans in, carefully and quietly for some
reason, and SLIPS the envelope from the lifeless fingers.
Unsealed. She opens it.It is empty.97.Before this can even sink in, a rattling, grating DRAW OF
BREATH - from Fran.
Marta starts - oh my god - and goes to her, checking a
pulse, checking her eyes, lays her on her back.  Fran sucksin thin breath, her eyes finding Marta in the glare of thedropped phone flashlight.

Her eyes seize.  Her breath gets ragged.  Marta is paralyzedwith shock and fear.  Fran is dying.
Marta looks at the medical bag in her hand.  Then at Fran,
struggling with her final breaths, eyes wide with fear.
She takes a step back from the dying Fran.  Fingers tight
around the medical bag.  Letting her die. 
But then, a decision: no.  Marta dials 911 on speaker, drops
to her knees and starts administering mouth to mouth.98.PHONE
911, what is your emergency?

Blanc sitting in the car, singing softly to himself.
BLANC

He looks at the hair salon - what's taking so long?  Andthen sirens, as an AMBULANCE pulls up two doors down, andEMT's run into the abandoned storefront.

Marta and Blanc sitting silently in the fluorescent-lit

Alright my friend, thank you for theupdate.  No I'm here with her.  Noneed for that, I'll bring her in oncewe get word that the housekeeper isstable.  It's still touch and go.

Alright.
He hangs up.  Marta looks at him.
MARTA
This is over.  People are gettinghurt.  I'm going to tell you thetruth.
BLANC
Young Ransom just told LieutenantElliott everything.  Who just told meeverything.99.MARTA
Good.  Wait god I hope he
didn't cover for me, did hetell the real truth, aboutme switching the- And the disguise and allthe-And the blackmail with the-BLANC
Yeah
Yes
Mm.
MARTA
But why did Fran take my morphine? Obviously she had swiped my bag fromthe house, but she didn't seem like auser to me, unless that's why sheneeded money...

I dunno, doesn't matter.  I shouldtell the Thrombeys myself, I feellike I owe that to them.
BLANC
I don't think that's a good idea
MARTA
No, I need to do it.  I won't do anyof this if I can't do that.  I reallyneed to.  I gave the doctors mynumber, they'll call if anythingchanges with Fran.
BLANC
We'll round up the Thrombeys at thehouse, along with a police escort.
MARTA
For the arrest after.
BLANC
You can tell me your whole story onthe drive over.  I want no moresurprises.
Marta stands, a dead man walking, resigned.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS
Marta's car drives through the scenic countryside.  Inside
we see but don't hear her telling a long story to Blanc, wholooks at the passing countryside, brow knit.100.EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - AFTERNOON

She turns the engine off.  Looks up at the house.  Breathes.
BLANC
Alright.  Are you ready?
INT. FOYER
Marta and Blanc enter.  This really feels like a walk
towards the gallows.  Richard, Walt and Meg are there.  Megavoids eye contact with Marta.
RICHARD
Ah.  Ok, has she come to her senses?
WALT
She's standing right there Richardshe can speak for herself -
BLANC
Is the rest of the family here?
WALT
In the living room.BLANC
I think maybe, if wecould...
Blanc beckons, and Richard and Walt file out.  On her wayout Meg hugs Marta, weeping.
MEG
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told themabout your mom.  I was angry andscared, I'm sorry
MARTA
It's ok, Meg.  I understand.  Believeme.  It's alright.
Meg sniffs, dries her eyes.101.MEG
God I am so raiding Fran's stash
after this.
They hug one more time.  Then when Meg walks off towards theliving room, Marta realizes something. Blanc walks back.
BLANC
I still think this is a bad idea, butthe family is assembled.
MARTA
to Blanc( )
I know where the tox report is.
INT. DRAWING ROOM
Marta jimmies the clock drawer open with a letter opener.She pulls a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER from inside, blows loose
pot leaves off it.  She hands it to Blanc.
MARTA
She practically told me where it was. Anyway this'll tie everything up. And I just handed it to you, godyou're  you're not much of adetective are you?
BLANC
To be fair you're a pretty lousymurderer.  Perhaps we deserve eachother.
INT. LIVING ROOM
The family gathered, impatient.  Lieutenant Elliott and
Trooper Wagner are there too, with another uniformedofficer.  Ransom sits in the corner, his face passive.
Marta gulps.  Blanc is a few steps behind her.  As she
speaks, he unfolds and reads the tox report.
MARTA
Um.  You guys have always been goodto me.  And what I'm about to sayisn't going to be easy, and you'regoing to be upset, but especiallyafter everything you've gone throughthe past few days, I thought youdeserved to hear it from me.102.Walt smiles at her, "you're doing the right thing."  Marta
takes a deep breath.
Blanc has finished reading the report.  He refolds it
carefully.
MARTA(cont'd)
I -
BLANC
Excuse me.  You have not been good toher.  You have all treated her likeshit to steal back a fortune that youlost and she deserves.  You're a packof bloody vultures at the feast, butyou're not getting bailed out, notthis time.

Ms. Cabrera has decided definitivelynot to renounce the inheritance.
WALT
What?
MARTA
What?
BLANC
Furthermore it will be myprofessional recommendation to thelocal authorities that the manner ofdeath in the case of Harlan Thrombeyis ruled as suicide, and the case isclosed.
RANSOM
What?
MARTA
What?  No, Blanc -BLANC
Thank you all for cominggoodbye.
He firmly guides Marta out by the elbow.  A beat of silence.
RICHARD
Is anybody else confused?
As the family breaks out in hubub, Linda notices her dad'sOLD BASEBALL on the side table where Blanc left it.  What'sthat doing here?  She picks it up.103.INT. LIBRARY
Blanc steers Marta into the library, as sounds of hubub and
shouting come from the other room.
MARTA
What the hell?  I want to come clean,this is over -
BLANC
Almost.
Elliott bursts in, motions to the living room, then Marta,then Blanc.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
What - with - what?
BLANC
I'm sorry - officer Wagner!
Wagner enters.
BLANC(cont'd)
Please keep the family out of thisroom and get them out of the house ifyou can.  But stand by with youradditional officer.
TROOPER WAGNER
Get the family out?
BLANC
Yes but not all of them.
Blanc whispers something to Wagner, who nods and exits.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc c'mon, what's all this Drama.
BLANC
Indulge me.
Marta sits.  Elliott remains standing.
MARTA
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom toldyou, I'm telling you now - it is animmovable fact that I killed Harlan.
BLANC
Yes you did, yes he did, yes you are,but.  But. 
(MORE)104.I spoke in the car about the hole atBLANC(cont'd)
the center of this donut.  And yes,
what you and Harlan did that fatefulnight seems at first glance to fillthat hole perfectly.  A donut hole inthe donut's hole.  But we must look alittle closer.  And when we do, wesee that the donut hole has a hole inits center - it is not a donut holeat all but a smaller donut with itsown hole, and our donut is not wholeat all!
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Blanc I understand that this isamusing for you -
BLANC
Why.  Was.  I.  Hired? Why wouldsomeone hire me?
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Someone fishing for any crime thatcould help reverse the will.
BLANC
I was hired before the sealed willwas read.  Yes, the person must haveknown the contents of the will.  Butone step further - that same personmust have known a crime wascommitted, and further, if the intentwas to reverse Marta's inheritance,they must have known that Marta wasresponsible.
beat()
An intriguing combination of factors. Someone who knew what Marta did,wanted to expose it, but could notreveal how
 they knew.
MARTA
Fran?  She was blackmailing me, sheknew what I did
BLANC
But Fran wanted money, ergo she didnot
 want the crime exposed.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Did someone in the family see Martadoing something suspicious?105.BLANC
They would have had no reason to not
speak up.  No.  The answer is not sosimple.
Blanc sits, suddenly weary.
BLANC(cont'd)
Now with the entire solution in myfield of view, the arc of this caseis a tragedy of errors.  And Marta,it will not be easy to hear.  Butthere is at least one truly guiltyparty behind it all, guilty in thetrue sense of acting with malice, andcommitting a heinous crime withselfish intent.
calls()
Trooper Wagner.
MARTA
stunned( )
Trooper Wagner??
Blanc squints at her.  No.
A moment later Wagner leads Ransom in.  Ransom looks at
Marta softly, sadly.
RANSOM
Marta I'm sorry.  I told themeverything, I figured it was all up. I'm sorry.
MARTA
It's alright Ransom, I'm glad youdid.
BLANC
Not exactly everything though. 
MARTA
Is this about what Greatnana toldyou?  She saw me
 that night, she
mistook me for Ransom
BLANC
We'll get to that.  But first, Mr.Hugh Ransom Drysdale, you might tellus all why you hired me.
RANSOM
Why I hired you?106.BLANC
You're right, let's back up.  To the
night of the party.  Your argumentwith Harlan.  What were the overheardwords by the Nazi child masturbatingin the bathroom - "my will" and "I'mwarning you."  You and Harlan were"drama mamas," you shared a love oftwisting the knife into one another. I don't believe he would have slippedit in halfway - no, I submit thatHarlan told you everything.
INT. SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom and Harlan face each other.
RANSOM
You can't be serious.
HARLAN
Not a red dime or word of my work to
a single one of them, you included.
INT. LIBRARY
BLANC
Marta, remind me what Ransom said hisconversation with Harlan ended with.
MARTA
Harlan told him that I could beat himin GO.
BLANC
And I asked myself - Marta?  Whywould the topic of the will havesteered around to Marta?  There isone obvious explanation...
INT. SMALL STUDY - NIGHT OF PARTY
RANSOM
You are not this crazy.  You wouldnot just throw your fortune away
HARLAN
No.  I'm giving it to Marta.  All ofit.107.RANSOM

Push into a vent in the wall.

RANSOM
That is some heavy duty conjecture.
BLANC
Granted.  But it's the only way what

MARTA
Clarity.  That he has to make do forhimself from here on out.
BLANC
Exactly.
EXT. NORFOLK ROADS - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom's Porsche SKIDS TO A STOP on the side of the empty
road.  Sits idling.
BLANC (V.O.)
Marta.  The will.  Harlan.  "Youwon't get away with this."  Do foryourself.  And a plan forms.
A beat.  Then the Porsche roars into a skidding U-TURN anddrives back the way it came.108.EXT. PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT OF PARTY
Ransom's Porsche kills its lights and drives slowly down the
private road, hooking a left at the CARVED ELEPHANT thatmarks the utility road.
BLANC (V.O.)
You return, careful to avoid thegate's security camera range.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT OF PARTY
The Porsche parked, Ransom hacks his way through the woods.
BLANC (V.O.)
Then on foot up towards the house,
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTYThe party is still going on inside.  Ransom slips through
the side gate, up towards the house, and up the trellis.
BLANC (V.O.)
You sneak in, up the trellis so asnot to be seen by the rest of thefamily, who are still having theirparty downstairs.
INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT OF PARTY
The painting wall swings aside, and Ransom climbs through,
leaving mud traces on the sill and the carpet.  He headsstraight down the narrow hall and into Harlan's bedroom. The party din from downstairs.
BLANC (V.O.)
What you need to do will takemoments.  But it is essential you arealone, and undetected.
Ransom disappears into the darkened doorway.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
You knew the medications Harlan took. You knew what Marta would beinjecting him with that night. 
(MORE)109.And you knew if Marta was responsibleBLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
for his death, even unintentionally,
the slayer rule would nullify thechanged will, and you would get yourshare back.
INT. HARLAN'S BEDROOM
Dark and still.  Marta's medical bag, open.  Ransom has
unwrapped two syringes and has the two vials out - theToradol and the morphine (the "good stuff.")
Using the syringes he extracts the liquid from both vials...
and then injects the liquids back into the opposite vials. He SWITCHES THE MEDICATIONS.
BLANC (V.O.)
You use the syringes in the kit toswitch the liquids in the twomedication vials.  And as a finalprecaution, you take the Naloxone,the life saving antidote.
Replacing the vials he takes an injection pen, closes thebag up and leaves.
INT. LIBRARY
Marta is stunned, she can't even process this.
MARTA
No, no that's impossible. 
BLANC
It is the truth.  Hand me that vial
of morphine, I'll show you.
Blanc has placed two identical vials on the table behindMarta.  Her mind is still spinning, she glances at them,takes one and absently hands it to him.
MARTA
If he did that, if the meds wereswitched, then when I got them mixedup...
oh my god( )
I accidentally switched them back. But then I gave Harlan110.BLANC
The correct doses.  Yes.  But not
accidentally.  I taped over thelabels of these two vials. 
Blanc shows white tape over the one she just handed him. Picks up the other vial, shows the same.
BLANC(cont'd)
The vials themselves are identical. How did you know that this was themorphine?
MARTA
I... just knew
BLANC
You knew because there is theslightest, almost imperceptibledifference of tincture and viscositybetween the liquids.  You knewbecause you had done it a hundredtimes.  You gave him the correctmedication.  Because you are a goodnurse.
MARTA
Then Harlan was...
BLANC
I'm sorry Marta.  But yes.  Harlanwas perfectly fine.
He unfolds the tox report and hands it to her.
BLANC(cont'd)
His blood was normal.  The cause ofdeath was truly, solely suicide, andyou are guilty of nothing but somedamage to the trellis and a fewamateur theatrics.  In fact if he hadlistened to you, he would be alivetoday.
Marta is white as a ghost.  She shudders, buckles over.
LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT
Hot damn.
BLANC

CUT TO:  the exact same scene but RANSOM hops down off the

Marta with her fingers on her temples, still unbelieving.
RANSOM

This is stoopid with two o's and you

BLANC
Not a shred no, just as we have noreal proof of Marta's mixing up thevials so it's your word against -
RANSOM
You have her confession!
The sharpness of this makes Marta look at Ransom for thefirst time.
BLANC
Ah right, we do have that.  If you'llindulge me, I'd like to spin a littlefurther. 112.EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE SIDE YARD - NIGHT OF PARTY - FLASHBACK
Moonlit, silent. 
BLANC (V.O.)
Much later that night you would have
to come back to the house, to breakback in and retrieve theincriminating tampered vials.
A dark figure, Ransom, approaches the side gate.  But whenhe opens it, the two dogs come bounding across the lawn,barking loudly.
BLANC (V.O.) (cont'd)
However, this time the dogs wereoutside.  They barked.  Waking Meg.
A light goes on upstairs.  The dogs keep barking, paws onthe gate.  Ransom backs off.

By Linda.  She's about to leave, but she notices the pink
envelope on the desk.  Picks it up, takes out the blanknote.  Seems to recognize it, and smiles sadly.
EXT. THROMBEY ESTATE FRONT DRIVE - LATER
Linda comes outside and joins the family.Several more police cars, and an ambulance.   Ransom is
loaded into the cop car.  His family are held at bay byofficers, but they react in different ways -
Richard yelling at the cops.  Walt sobbing, Donna collapsed
against him, Jacob on his phone.
Joni staring into space, ruined.  Meg talking to Lieutenant
Elliott, crying.  She's just learned about Fran.
Linda watches the circus, strangely disconnected, going to
light a cigarette.  With a strange smirk, she uses the flameto warm the blank note from the office, and HIDDEN WRITINGstarts to appear - a note from her father.  Their secretcommunication.  As the letters appear, her face changes.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Marta sits, a blanket over her shoulders.  An officer who's
just taken her statement walks away.  Blanc approaches.
MARTA
Can I ask.  At what point did yoususpect I had something to do withHarlan's death?123.BLANC
From the moment you first set foot in
front of me.
Taps her shoe.  The tiny, faded spot of blood.
MARTA
Oh my god.
BLANC
I want you to remember something veryimportant:  you won not by playingthe game Harlan's way, but yours.
Through the window she sees the family outside.
MARTA
I should help them.  Right?
BLANC
I have my own opinion.  But I have afeeling you'll follow your heart.
He gives her a wink, and strolls off.
INT. FOYER - LATER
Marta shuffles to the front doorway.  One last glance at
Harlan's portrait, its grin now gentle and content.
EXT. FRONT PORCH / BALCONY
She stands on the threshold.  Sees Blanc get into the front
door of a cruiser, and it drives off - Ransom in the back. He looks back at her through the window.
The family out on the lawn.  Not sure where to go or what to
do.  They all turn to see:  Marta standing very small, butsomehow not, in the doorway of her house.124.
