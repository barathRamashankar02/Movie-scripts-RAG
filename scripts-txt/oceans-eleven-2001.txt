Danny considers it.  Will he put it on?5EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON5A sign reads:  "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITYCORRECTIONAL FACILITY."  Someone has graffitied below it:"If you were in prison, you'd be home now."The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within itsframe, ready for release.  (If it matters -- and if younotice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)He hovers there for a moment, on the precipice offreedom.  The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side ofthe gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (NewJersey):  Life is hard out there.But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first stepinto free America...A6EXT.

He's home.ON DANNY'S WALLETAs he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them ongreen felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile ofchips.4.7AT BLACKJACK TABLE7Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking forsomeone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- butwithout success.

Danny wins again.A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizeshim with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he wasscouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiarface is welcome.DANNYHello, Frank.The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, andhis eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he'sdealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself.  Hequickly hides his astonishment.FRANKI beg your pardon, sir.  You musthave me confused with someoneelse.  My name is Ramon.  See?He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he isthe most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen.

LAB - DAY120Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator. BASHER (V.O.)A pinch is the equivalent of acardiac arrest for any broad-bandelectrical circuitry.  Or betteryet:  A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb.  Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, itunleashes an electromagnetic pulsewhich shuts down any power sourcewithin its vicinity.  That tendsnot to matter in most casesbecause the nuclear weapondestroys everything you might needpower for anyway.  Now a pinch creates a similar electromagneticpulse, but without the headache ofmass destruction and death.  Soinstead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.A121INT.
